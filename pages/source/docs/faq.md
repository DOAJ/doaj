## How do I reset my password?

  If you cannot log in, you can [reset your password](/account/forgot). An email is sent to your email address with a rest link. That link is only valid for 24 hours. Check your Spam folder to make sure the link doesn't go in there. If you do not receive the email, [contact us](/contact/).

## I haven't heard anything about the application or update I submitted

  Most applications are processed within three (3) months. Some applications take longer. We aim to have all applications processed within six (6) months. Please wait 3 months until you ask for a status update. Due to the volume of emails that we receive, we cannot answer status updates for applications which are less than three months old. 
  
  We aim to process updates to journals already in DOAJ in three (3) weeks.

## I know a journal which should be in DOAJ but isn’t. What should I do?

  Contact the journal and ask them to submit an application. You can also send us the details of the journal—title and ISSN—and we will contact them.

## The journal I am looking for isn’t in DOAJ. Why?

  Maybe the journal hasn’t applied to us or its application is still in progress. Maybe the journal was [removed from DOAJ](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/183mRBRqs2jOyP0qZWXN8dUd02D4vL0Mov_kgYF8HORM/edit#gid=1650882189&range=A1).

## How do I report a bug or ask for technical help?

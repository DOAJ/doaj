Journals and their articles are categorised by our editorial team using a subset of the [Library of Congress Classification](https://www.loc.gov/catdir/cpso/lcco/). The classification is assigned when a journal is accepted and, if a publisher chooses to upload article metadata to us, the articles inherit the same classification.

It may be that the specific subject area you are looking for is not represented in the LCC list that we use. Try using a related term instead or doing a search.

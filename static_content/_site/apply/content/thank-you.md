## Thank you for your application.

You should receive three automated emails from us:

2. A second email when the application is assigned to an editor.
3. A third email when the editor starts working on it.
  - Look out for more emails from our editors about your application.
  - The person reviewing your application may not be using a doaj.org email address. If you are not sure that the person you are writing to is authorised to represent DOAJ, please check the [list of volunteers]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link about/volunteers.md %}).

Check your spam folder for emails from us. It’s important that you respond to our questions.

We don’t reply to requests for status updates on applications that are less than three months old.

It may take **up to six months** before you get a final decision. Most applications are processed in three months.

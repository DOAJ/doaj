## Thank you for your application.

You will receive an automated email from us, confirming that your application has been received, in the next few minutes. Please [contact us]({{ site.baseurl }}contact/) if you don’t receive it.

You will receive two more status updates if your application is assigned to an editorial group for review. If a Managing editor processes your application, this step is skipped.

Further emails from the reviewer may be sent asking questions about your application.
  - The person reviewing your application may not be using a doaj.org email address. If you are not sure that the person you are writing to is authorised to represent DOAJ, please check the [list of volunteers]({{ site.baseurl }}about/volunteers.md %}).
  - Check your spam folder for emails. It’s important that you respond to our questions.

We don’t reply to requests for status updates on applications that are less than three months old.

It may take **up to six months** before you get a final decision. Most applications are processed in three months.

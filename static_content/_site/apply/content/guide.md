- The ISSN(s) must be displayed on the website.
- The name of the journal in the application and on the website must match what is shown at [issn.org](https://portal.issn.org/).

---

### Quality control process

- A journal must have an editor and an editorial board.

  - The name and affiliation of all editors and board members must be included.
  - If the journal is run by a student body, it must have an advisory board of which at least two members have a PhD or equivalent.

- Copyright terms must not contradict the licensing terms or the terms of the open access policy.
  - “All rights reserved” is never appropriate for open access content.

## Additional criteria for some journal types

{:.tabular-list}
- ### Arts and humanities journals
   - For these disciplines ([pages 10-16 only](http://uis.unesco.org/sites/default/files/documents/international-standard-classification-of-education-fields-of-education-and-training-2013-detailed-field-descriptions-2015-en.pdf)), DOAJ can accept journals that undertake editorial review, rather than peer review. Editorial review must be handled with a minimum of two editors.

- ### Clinical case reports journals
   - DOAJ only considers case reports as research if they include the retrospective analysis of more than three clinical cases and/or a literature review. Before applying, make sure that the journal has published at least five articles per year that meet this definition.

- ### Conference proceedings journals
   - For DOAJ to include journals that are dedicated to publishing conference proceedings, the journal must have an ISSN and a permanent editorial or advisory board providing editorial oversight. Papers from each published conference must be peer-reviewed according to DOAJ criteria. Full text of all conference papers must be available. Individual conference proceedings will not be indexed.
   
- ### Data journals
   - DOAJ will accept journals publishing research articles about data or datasets, but not journals that simply link to datasets or announce their availability.

- ### Overlay journals
   - DOAJ will accept journals that select and peer-review articles that are hosted on a preprint server or other site.

- ### Student-run journals
   - If a journal is run by a student body, there must be an advisory board for the journal where at least two members have a PhD or equivalent qualification.

- ### Flipped journals
   - Where a journal was previously published as a subscription or hybrid journal and has now flipped to a fully open access model, this information must be clearly displayed:
      - The date of the change to fully open access
      - The availability of the archive material (open access, free, or paywalled)
      - Reuse rights of the archive material (all rights reserved or open license)
   - For a journal to be included in DOAJ, all content published after it has flipped must be completely open access.

- ### Mirror journals
   - A mirror journal is a fully open access version of an existing subscription journal, with the same editorial board, aims and scope, and peer review processes and policies. The journal may have a similar name as the subscription title, but it must have a different ISSN. DOAJ will currently accept mirror journals if they meet the usual basic criteria for inclusion.

## Further help on copyright and licensing

### Licensing

We recommend that you use Creative Commons licenses to show your readers how the published content can be used. In some cases, we will accept a publisher's own license if it is broadly equivalent to one of the Creative Commons licenses.

You may not add to or adapt the terms of a Creative Commons license. For example, you cannot display on your website: ‘[Other conditions] will apply and prevail over all conflicting provisions of the [open access] license’ model. Creative Commons states clearly that '[For the avoidance of doubt, where Exceptions and Limitations apply to Your use, this Public License does not apply](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/legalcode)'.

### Copyright

We recommend that journals allow authors to retain the copyright of their papers without restrictions. Authors may grant the publisher non-exclusive publishing rights to publish the articles. Granting the publisher the right of first publishing also qualifies as unrestricted copyright (because there is no restriction imposed by the publisher on the author's copyright).

Restrictions are sometimes imposed by the publisher even though the author retains copyright:
- The publisher requires exclusive publishing rights. The author no longer holds the copyright without restrictions.
- The publisher requires a transfer of commercial rights or an exclusive grant of commercial rights. The author no longer retains copyright without restrictions.

### The difficult bits about licensing and copyright together

The terms of the user license do not apply to the copyright holder. Therefore:
- when copyright is retained by the author without restrictions, the license applies to the readers and the publisher.
- when copyright is transferred to the publisher, the license applies to the readers and the author(s).
- when the author retains copyright but commercial rights are transferred to the publisher and a non-commercial license is used, the license applies to the reader and the author.
- when the author retains copyright but exclusive publishing rights are granted to the publisher, this is equivalent to the transfer of commercial rights to the publisher.

### Fair use

An open access journal cannot restrict the rights of the author to fair use only. This is not open access and we will not accept a journal with these restrictions. A common example of fair use is when a journal allows authors to only retain the rights to:
- use the substance of the article in future works, including lectures and books;
- reproduce the article for one's own purposes, provided that copies are not offered for sale;
- self-archive the article.

## The application process

1. Your application is successfully submitted when you see a _Thank You_ screen and receive a confirmation email.
  - If you do not receive that email, contact us.
2. Your application will be reviewed by an editor. You may receive an email alerting you when this process has started.
3. The editor may need to contact you as part of the review process. Please answer any questions they send you. This helps us process your application correctly. Be aware that we will reject an application if, after one month, we haven't received answers to our questions.
4. The editor reviewing your application may be a volunteer and will not have a doaj.org email address. Check your spam folder frequently just in case the emails have ended up there.
5. If your application is accepted, you will receive an email to confirm this.

### Time from submission to decision

The time from submission to decision varies greatly and is dependent on the responsiveness of the journal contact and/or applicant. Generally a decision is reached within three months.
We cannot provide a status update for applications which are less than three months old.

## Updating your journal record

For journals that have been accepted into DOAJ, it is important that the information we hold about them is up to date. 

You can update the journal information by logging into your account and going to your Publisher dashboard. Under 'My journals' is a list of all the journals connected to your account. Use the black 'Update' button, next to each journal record, to submit an update request to us.

A journal update request form will open with the current answers pre-filled. Change any answers that need to be updated. If you haven't updated the journal since before November 2020, when we revised the form, we suggest that you review every answer. Note that some questions may not have an answer, as new questions were added in November 2020.

Once you have amended and reviewed the answers, submit the update request to us.

Update requests are reviewed by the DOAJ editorial team for accuracy and we aim to process them within six weeks of submission.

---

## If your application is rejected

You will receive an email giving the reasons for rejection of the application. Unless otherwise advised by DOAJ staff, you may not submit another application for the same journal until 6 months after the date of the notification of rejection.

You are responsible for providing accurate information when submitting an application. Applications that contain information that is inaccurate or wrong, or that have answers missing, are automatically rejected. 
In cases where journal information is found to be untrue or misleading, DOAJ may decide not to allow further applications from the publisher for a period of up to three years.

DOAJ accepts only journals that follow good publishing practice. If our review finds a publisher is not adhering to best practice, or has questionable publishing practices, DOAJ will not allow further applications from that publisher for a period of up to three years.

Journals already accepted into DOAJ may be removed if they are found to be no longer adhering to DOAJ criteria or publishing best practice.

Please ensure that, if you do apply again after the exclusion period, the journal meets the DOAJ criteria for inclusion and any necessary changes have been made to the journal website or policies.

## Appeals

If you would like to appeal against a decision to reject your application for more than 6 months or remove your journal from DOAJ, send an email to the DOAJ Managing Editors, [managing-editors@doaj.org](mailto:managing-editors@doaj.org).

The appeal should contain the following information:
- Journal title
- Journal ISSN
- Reason for appeal
- Evidence for the DOAJ Appeals Committee to consider
- The original notification of rejection/removal

Appeals are considered by the DOAJ Appeals Committee, consisting of the Editor-in-Chief and members of the editorial team. Committee meetings are held monthly. After your case is discussed a member of the Committee will contact you with the result of your appeal. This will not be the same Managing Editor who handled your case originally.

No further communication will be entered into after the appeal is heard and the Committee has made their decision.

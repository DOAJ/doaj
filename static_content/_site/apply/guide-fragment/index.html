  </li>
  <li>
    <h3 id="law-journals">Law journals</h3>

    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>
    <h3 id="student-run-journals">Student-run journals</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>If a journal is run by a student body, there must be an advisory board for the journal where at least two members have a PhD or equivalent qualification.</li>

  </li>
  <li>
    <h3 id="journals-that-have-flipped-to-open-access">Journals that have flipped to open access</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Where a journal was previously published as a subscription or hybrid journal and has now flipped to a fully open access model, this information must be clearly displayed:

    </ul>
  </li>

    <ul>
      <li>A mirror journal is a fully open access version of an existing subscription journal, with the same editorial board, aims and scope, and peer review processes and policies.

  </li>
</ul>

<h2 id="the-application-process">The application process</h2>

<ol>
  <li>Once you have submitted your application, you will see a <em>Thank You</em> screen and will be sent an automated confirmation email.
    <ul>
      <li>If you do not receive that email, contact us.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>You will receive another automated email telling you when your application has been picked up for review. Every application goes through up to four rounds of assessment.</li>
  <li>One of our Associate Editors might contact you during the review process.
    <ul>
      <li>We will automatically reject the application if we receive no response to our emails after one month. Check your spam folder frequently.</li>
      <li>Be aware that the Associate Editor who is reviewing your application is a volunteer and may not be emailing you from a doaj.org email address.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>You will receive a third email informing you that a decision has been made:
    <ul>
      <li>If your application is accepted, another email is sent with your account details. You need these to upload article metadata and to send us updates about your journal.</li>
      <li>If your application is rejected, the email will detail on what grounds the application failed our review.</li>
    </ul>
    <ul>
      <li>You may not submit another application for the same journal for six months.</li>
      <li>If you re-apply, we expect the journal to demonstrate very clearly that our recommendations have been implemented.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ol>

<h3 id="time-from-submission-to-decision">Time from submission to decision</h3>

<p>The time from submission to decision varies greatly and is dependent on the responsiveness of the journal contact and/or applicant. It can take up to six months for a decision to be reached but often a decision is reached within three months.
We cannot provide a status update for applications which are less than three months old.</p>

<hr>

<h2 id="if-your-application-is-rejected">If your application is rejected</h2>

<p>You will receive an email giving the reasons for rejection of the application. Unless otherwise advised by DOAJ staff, you may not submit another application for the same journal until 6 months after the date of the notification of rejection.</p>

<p>You are responsible for providing accurate information when submitting an application. In cases where journal information is found to be untrue or misleading, DOAJ may decide not to allow further applications from the publisher for a period of up to three years.</p>

<p>DOAJ accepts only journals that follow good publishing practice. If our review finds a publisher is not adhering to best practice, or has questionable publishing practices, DOAJ will not allow further applications from that publisher for a period of up to three years.</p>

<p>Journals already accepted into DOAJ may also be removed if they are found to be no longer adhering to DOAJ criteria or publishing best practice.</p>

<p>Please ensure that, if you do apply again after the exclusion period, the journal meets the DOAJ criteria for inclusion and any necessary changes have been made to the journal website or policies.</p>

<hr>

<h2 id="appeals">Appeals</h2>

<p>If you would like to appeal against a decision to reject your application or remove your journal from DOAJ, send an email to the DOAJ Managing Editors, <a href="mailto:managing-editors@doaj.org">managing-editors@doaj.org</a>.</p>

<p>The appeal should contain the following information:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Journal title</li>
  <li>Journal ISSN</li>
  <li>Reason for appeal</li>
  <li>Evidence for the DOAJ Appeals Committee to consider</li>
  <li>The original notification of rejection/removal</li>
</ul>

<p>Appeals are considered by the DOAJ Appeals Committee, consisting of the Editor-in-Chief and members of the editorial team. Committee meetings are held monthly. After your case is discussed a member of the Committee will contact you with the result of your appeal. This will not be the same Managing Editor who handled your case originally.</p>

<p>No further communication will be entered into after the appeal is heard and the Committee has made their decision.</p>

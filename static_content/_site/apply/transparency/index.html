<h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>

<p>The <a href="https://publicationethics.org/">Committee on Publication Ethics</a>, the Directory of Open Access Journals, the <a href="https://publicationethics.org/">Open Access Scholarly Publishers Association</a> and the <a href="https://www.wame.org/">World Association of Medical Editors</a> are scholarly organizations that have seen an increase in the number, and broad range in the quality of, membership applications. Our organizations have collaborated to identify principles of transparency and best practice for scholarly publications and to clarify that these principles form the basis of the criteria by which suitability for membership is assessed by COPE, DOAJ and OASPA, and part of the criteria on which membership applications are evaluated by WAME. Each organization also has their own, additional criteria which are used when evaluating applications. The organizations will not share lists of publishers or journals that failed to demonstrate that they met the criteria for transparency and best practice.</p>

<p>This is the third version of a work in progress (published January 2018); the first version was made available by OASPA in December 2013 and a second version in June 2015. We encourage its wide dissemination and continue to welcome feedback on the general principles and the specific criteria. Background on the organizations is below.</p>

<p>An infographic of these Principles was commissioned by COPE and is available to download here:<br />

<h2 id="about-the-committee-on-publication-ethics-cope">About the <a href="https://publicationethics.org/">Committee on Publication Ethics</a> (COPE)</h2>

<p>COPE provides advice to editors and publishers on all aspects of publication ethics and, in particular, how to handle cases of research and publication misconduct. It also provides a forum for its members to discuss individual cases. COPE does not investigate individual cases but encourages editors to ensure that cases are investigated by the appropriate authorities (usually a research institution or employer). All COPE members are expected to apply COPE principles of publication ethics outlined in the core practices.</p>

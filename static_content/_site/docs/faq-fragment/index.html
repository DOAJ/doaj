<h2 id="how-do-i-reset-my-password">How do I reset my password?</h2>

<p>If you cannot log in, you can <a href="/account/forgot">reset your password</a>. An email is sent to your email address with a rest link. That link is only valid for 24 hours. Check your Spam folder to make sure the link doesn’t go in there. If you do not receive the email, <a href="/contact/">contact us</a>.</p>

<h2 id="i-havent-heard-anything-about-the-application-or-update-i-submitted">I haven’t heard anything about the application or update I submitted</h2>

<p>Most applications are processed within three (3) months. Some applications take longer. We aim to have all applications processed within six (6) months. Please wait 3 months until you ask for a status update. Due to the volume of emails that we receive, we cannot answer status updates for applications which are less than three months old.</p>

<p>We aim to process updates to journals already in DOAJ in three (3) weeks.</p>

<h2 id="i-know-a-journal-which-should-be-in-doaj-but-isnt-what-should-i-do">I know a journal which should be in DOAJ but isn’t. What should I do?</h2>

<p>Contact the journal and ask them to submit an application. You can also send us the details of the journal—title and ISSN—and we will contact them.</p>

<h2 id="the-journal-i-am-looking-for-isnt-in-doaj-why">The journal I am looking for isn’t in DOAJ. Why?</h2>

<p>Maybe the journal hasn’t applied to us or its application is still in progress. Maybe the journal was <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/183mRBRqs2jOyP0qZWXN8dUd02D4vL0Mov_kgYF8HORM/edit#gid=1650882189&amp;range=A1" target="_blank" rel="noopener">removed from DOAJ</a>.</p>

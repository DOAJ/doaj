<p>Please be aware that if you disable all Javascript, searching DOAJ won’t work properly. This is because some of the code that is required is served by Google’s Javascript library. Once this is disabled, DOAJ search will fail.</p>

<p>If you can select which components can be switched off, then you can continue to use DOAJ.</p>

<p>Another Javascript component is <a href="https://getbootstrap.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Bootstrap</a> which is the framework used to build the DOAJ website. This contains Javascript for some of its features.</p>

    + If it happened several times, then all dates/times that were recorded, or a range.</li>

<h2 id="metadata">Metadata</h2>

<h3 id="how-can-i-get-journal-metadata-from-doaj">How can I get journal metadata from DOAJ?</h3>

<h4 id="api">API</h4>

<p>A <a href="">search API</a> is available. Some functions require an API key. To get your API key, go to your account page. If no API key is available, <a href="">contact us</a>.</p>

<h4 id="atom-feed">Atom feed</h4>

<p>We have <a href="/feed">an Atom feed</a> of journals which is updated every time a new journal is added to DOAJ.</p>

<h4 id="crawling">Crawling</h4>

<p>You may crawl DOAJ as long as you follow our good behaviour guidelines for crawling:</p>
<ul>
  <li>follow our robot.txt file http://doaj.org/robots.txt</li>
  <li>use our sitemap</li>
  <li>obey our rate limit</li>
</ul>

<p>If your crawler hits our servers too often, or your crawler starts to affect DOAJ’s performance in any way, then your access will be restricted or even blocked. (It’s faster and easier for you to collect our metadata if you connect via the API.)</p>

<h4 id="csv-file">CSV file</h4>

<p>You can download the list of journals as a CSV (comma-separated) file. This can be imported into any compatible analysis program. The CSV file is updated every 30 minutes.</p>
<ul>
  <li>Download the file to your computer</li>
  <li>Import the file into a spreadsheet processing program (like Excel or OpenOffice)</li>
  <li>Make sure you choose Unicode (UTF-8) as the file origin.</li>
</ul>

<h4 id="data-dumps">Data dumps</h4>

<p>You can <a href="">download all of our journal and article metadata</a> as two static files. They are refreshed weekly.</p>

<h4 id="oai-pmh">OAI-PMH</h4>

<p>DOAJ supports the OAI protocol for metadata harvesting (OAI-PMH). Any OAI compatible service can obtain records from DOAJ. The base URL is <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">http://www.doaj.org/oai</code>. You can add most OAI verbs and other commands directly on to that. There is a full description of this service on the <a href="">OAI-PMH documentation page</a>. Our current OAI offering is standardised around Dublin Core.</p>

<h3 id="why-do-some-journals-have-no-or-very-little-article-metadata-in-doaj">Why do some journals have no or very little article metadata in DOAJ?</h3>

<p>We do not yet crawl publisher sites to collect article metadata. Instead, we ask publishers to upload the metadata to us. If a journal in DOAJ has no articles, it is because the metadata hasn’t been sent to us.</p>

<h2 id="what-code-is-doaj-built-with">What code is DOAJ built with?</h2>

<p>DOAJ is a Python/Flask web app with a JSON document store. The code is open source and can be found in <a href="https://github.com/DOAJ/doaj" target="_blank" rel="noopener">our GitHub repository</a>.</p>

<p>DOAJ uses Bootstrap which is the framework used to build the DOAJ website. This contains some Javascript for some of its features.</p>

<h2 id="finding-content-in-doaj">Finding content in DOAJ</h2>

<h3 id="browsing-by-subject">Browsing by subject</h3>

<p>The subject classifications used to <a href="">Browse by subject</a> page are structured as follows:</p>

<ul>
  <li>subjects separated by a full stop (.) are part of the same category. For example: ‘Philosophy. Psychology. Religion’ is one category.</li>
  <li>where two subjects are separated by a colon (:), the second subject is a subcategory of the first. For example: ‘Philosophy. Psychology. Religion: Philosophy (General)’. This journal has been categorised as General Philosophy.</li>
  <li>where subjects are separated by a pipe (|), the second category has no relation to the first. For example: ‘Philosophy. Psychology. Religion: Philosophy (General) | Social Sciences: Social sciences (General)’ means that this journal has been categorised both as General Philosophy and General Social Sciences.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="searching-by-keyword">Searching by keyword</h3>

<p>You can choose to filter your search results by ‘keyword’.</p>

<p>Journal keywords are chosen by the person applying for a journal. They are reviewed and edited by the DOAJ Team. They are more arbitrary than the subject classification.</p>

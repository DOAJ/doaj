            <h1>Accessibility statement for doaj.org</h1>

            

            <p>This accessibility statement applies to <a href="https://www.doaj.org" target="_blank" rel="noopener">doaj.org</a> exclusively.</p>

<p>Its subdomain <a href="https://blog.doaj.org" target="_blank" rel="noopener">blog.doaj.org</a> and its sister site, <a href="https://www.doajbestpracticeguide.org" target="_blank" rel="noopener">doajbestpracticeguide.org</a>, are WordPress sites and <strong>are not covered by this statement</strong>.</p>

<p>This website is run by DOAJ, on behalf of IS4OA. We want as many people as possible to be able to use this website. For example, that means you should be able to:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Change colours, contrast levels and fonts.</li>
  <li>Zoom in up to 300% without the text spilling off the screen.</li>
  <li>Navigate most of the website using just a keyboard.</li>
  <li>Navigate most of the website using speech recognition software.</li>
  <li>Listen to most of the website using a screen reader (including the most recent versions of JAWS, NVDA and VoiceOver).</li>
  <li>We’ve also made the website text as simple as possible to understand, following guidelines laid out by <a href="https://www.plainlanguage.gov" target="_blank" rel="noopener">PlainLanguage.gov</a> and <a href="https://www.plainenglish.co.uk" target="_blank" rel="noopener">PlainEnglish.co.uk</a>.</li>
</ul>

<p><a href="https://abilitynet.org.uk/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">AbilityNet</a> has advice on making your device easier to use if you have a disability.</p>

<h2 id="how-accessible-is-this-website">How accessible is this website?</h2>

<p>We know some parts of this website may not be fully accessible:</p>

<ul>
  <li>The Publisher, Editor, and Admin dashboards (accessible via log-in only) are not responsive and accessible.</li>
  <li>You cannot use the journal or article search function with Javascript disabled.
    <ul>
      <li>However, if you are using a device that renders JavaScript, the HTML output will be accessible.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>You cannot modify the line height or spacing of the text.</li>
  <li>Some blog posts contain links to older PDF documents which are not fully accessible to screen reader software.</li>
  <li>The <a href="/support/supporters"><em>Supporters</em></a> page contains an embedded map and a spreadsheet which may not be accessible to screen reader software.</li>
</ul>

<p>We are continuing to update this document as we find accessibility issues or as we fix them.</p>

<h2 id="enforcement-procedure">Enforcement procedure</h2>

<p>The Equality and Human Rights Commission (EHRC) is responsible for enforcing the Public Sector Bodies (Websites and Mobile Applications) (No. 2) Accessibility Regulations 2018 (the ‘accessibility regulations’). If you’re not happy with how we respond to your complaint, contact the Equality Advisory and Support Service (EASS).</p>

<h2 id="technical-information-about-this-websites-accessibility">Technical information about this website’s accessibility</h2>

<p>DOAJ is committed to making its website accessible, in accordance with the Public Sector Bodies (Websites and Mobile Applications) (No. 2) Accessibility Regulations 2018.</p>

<h3 id="compliance-status">Compliance status</h3>

<p>This website is partially compliant with the <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG21/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Web Content Accessibility Guidelines version 2.1 AA standard</a>, due to the non-compliances listed below.</p>

<h2 id="non-accessible-content">Non-accessible content</h2>

<p>The content listed below is non-accessible for the following reasons.</p>

<h3 id="non-compliance-with-the-accessibility-regulations">Non-compliance with the accessibility regulations</h3>

<ul>
  <li>Some images may not have a text alternative, so people using a screen reader cannot access the information. This fails WCAG 2.1 Success Criterion 1.1.1 (Non-text content).</li>
  <li>Some form fields may be missing a label identifying the purpose of its corresponding field. This fails WCAG Success Criterion 1.3.5 (Identify Input Purpose).</li>
</ul>

<p>We plan to fix these issues to meet accessibility standards by February 2021.</p>

<h3 id="disproportionate-burden">Disproportionate burden</h3>

<ul>
  <li>Navigation and accessing information: it’s not always possible to change the device orientation from horizontal to vertical without making it more difficult to view the content. This fails WCAG Success Criterion 1.3.4 (Orientation).</li>
  <li>Navigation and accessing information: there’s no way to skip the repeated content in the page header (for example, a ‘skip to main content’ option).</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="content-thats-not-within-the-scope-of-the-accessibility-regulations">Content that’s not within the scope of the accessibility regulations</h3>

<ul>
  <li>PDFs and other documents: we have PDFs that were published in older blog posts but are not essential to our services (searching the database and applying to the database). The accessibility regulations <a href="https://www.legislation.gov.uk/uksi/2018/952/regulation/4/made" target="_blank" rel="noopener">do not require us to fix PDFs or other documents published before 23 September 2018</a> if they’re not essential to providing our services. Any new PDFs or Word documents we publish will meet accessibility standards.</li>
</ul>

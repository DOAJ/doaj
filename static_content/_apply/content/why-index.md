|   | Reputation and prominence | DOAJ is the most important [community-driven, open access service in the world](http://repository.jisc.ac.uk/6269/10/final-KE-Report-V5.1-20JAN2016.pdf) and has a reputation for advocating quality, best practices and standards in open access. By indexing your journal in DOAJ, its reputation and prominence will be enhanced. |
|   | Standards and best practice | DOAJ's [basic criteria for inclusion](/apply/guide/) have become the accepted way of measuring an open access journal's adherence to standards in scholarly publishing. We can help you adopt a range of ethical and quality standards, making your journals more attractive publishing channels. <br>DOAJ is tackling the problem of unethical practice, and is committed to combatting questionable publishers and questionable publishing practices, helping to protect researchers from becoming trapped by these journals. |
|   | Funding and compliance | Open access publication funds often require that authors who want funding must publish in journals that are indexed in DOAJ. Indexing in DOAJ makes your journals compliant with many initiatives and programmes around the world, for example [Plan S](https://www.coalition-s.org/) in Europe or  [Capes/Qualis](http://capes.gov.br/images/Relatorio_qualis_periodicos_referencia_2019/Relatorio_qualis_ensino.pdf) in Brazil. |
|   | Discoverability and visibility | DOAJ metadata is free for anyone to collect and use which means it is easily incorporated into search engines and discovery services. It is then propagated across the Internet. <br>If you provide us with article metadata for your journal, this will be supplied to all the major aggregators and the many research organisations and university library portals who use our widgets, RSS feeds, API and other services. <br>Indexing your journal in DOAJ is likely to increase traffic to its website and the visibility of your published content. Levels of traffic to a journal website typically increase threefold after inclusion in DOAJ. Your journal will have more exposure worldwide. Your journal's visibility in search engines, such as Google, will improve. |
|   | International coverage  | Our database includes more open access journals from a diverse list of countries than any of the other major indexing services. We have a global editorial team via a network of Managing Editors, Ambassadors and volunteers so we will do our best to offer local support in your language. We promise you that information about your journal will be seen around the world. |

## Additional criteria for some journal types

{:.tabular-list}
- ### Arts and humanities journals
   - For these disciplines ([pages 10-16 only](http://uis.unesco.org/sites/default/files/documents/international-standard-classification-of-education-fields-of-education-and-training-2013-detailed-field-descriptions-2015-en.pdf)), DOAJ can accept journals that undertake editorial review, rather than peer review. Editorial review must be handled with a minimum of two editors.

- ### Clinical case reports journals
   - DOAJ only considers case reports as research if they include the retrospective analysis of more than three clinical cases and/or a literature review. Before applying, make sure that the journal has published at least five articles per year that meet this definition.

- ### Conference proceedings journals
   - For DOAJ to include journals that are dedicated to publishing conference proceedings, the journal must have an ISSN and a permanent editorial or advisory board providing editorial oversight. Papers from each published conference must be peer-reviewed according to DOAJ criteria. Full text of all conference papers must be available. Individual conference proceedings will not be indexed.
   
- ### Data journals
   - DOAJ will accept journals publishing research articles about data or datasets, but not journals that simply link to datasets or announce their availability.

- ### Overlay journals
   - DOAJ will accept journals that select and peer-review articles that are hosted on a preprint server or other site.

- ### Student-run journals
   - If a journal is run by a student body, there must be an advisory board for the journal where at least two members have a PhD or equivalent qualification.

- ### Flipped journals
   - Where a journal was previously published as a subscription or hybrid journal and has now flipped to a fully open access model, this information must be clearly displayed:
      - The date of the change to fully open access
      - The availability of the archive material (open access, free, or paywalled)
      - Reuse rights of the archive material (all rights reserved or open license)
   - For a journal to be included in DOAJ, all content published after it has flipped must be completely open access.

- ### Mirror journals
   - A mirror journal is a fully open access version of an existing subscription journal, with the same editorial board, aims and scope, and peer review processes and policies. The journal may have a similar name as the subscription title, but it must have a different ISSN. DOAJ will currently accept mirror journals if they meet the usual basic criteria for inclusion.

## The application process

1. Your application is successfully submitted when you see a _Thank You_ screen and receive a confirmation email.
  - If you do not receive that email, contact us.
2. Your application will then be reviewed. You may receive an email alerting you when this process has started.
3. One of our volunteer Associate Editors might contact you as part of the review process. Please answer any questions they send you. This helps us process your application correctly. Be aware that we will reject an application if, after one month, we haven't received answers to our questions.
4. The person reviewing your application may be a volunteer and therefore will not have a doaj.org email address. Check your spam folder frequently just in case the emails have ended up there.
5. If your application is accepted, an email is sent to you with your account details. You need these to log in and upload article metadata, send us updates about your journal, or manage your account.

### Time from submission to decision

The time from submission to decision varies greatly and is dependent on the responsiveness of the journal contact and/or applicant. It can take up to six months for a decision to be reached but often a decision is reached within three months.
We cannot provide a status update for applications which are less than three months old.

---

## If your application is rejected

You will receive an email giving the reasons for rejection of the application. Unless otherwise advised by DOAJ staff, you may not submit another application for the same journal until 6 months after the date of the notification of rejection.

You are responsible for providing accurate information when submitting an application. In cases where journal information is found to be untrue or misleading, DOAJ may decide not to allow further applications from the publisher for a period of up to three years.

DOAJ accepts only journals that follow good publishing practice. If our review finds a publisher is not adhering to best practice, or has questionable publishing practices, DOAJ will not allow further applications from that publisher for a period of up to three years.

Journals already accepted into DOAJ may also be removed if they are found to be no longer adhering to DOAJ criteria or publishing best practice.

Please ensure that, if you do apply again after the exclusion period, the journal meets the DOAJ criteria for inclusion and any necessary changes have been made to the journal website or policies.

## Appeals

If you would like to appeal against a decision to reject your application for more than 6 months or remove your journal from DOAJ, send an email to the DOAJ Managing Editors, [managing-editors@doaj.org](mailto:managing-editors@doaj.org).

The appeal should contain the following information:
- Journal title
- Journal ISSN
- Reason for appeal
- Evidence for the DOAJ Appeals Committee to consider
- The original notification of rejection/removal

Appeals are considered by the DOAJ Appeals Committee, consisting of the Editor-in-Chief and members of the editorial team. Committee meetings are held monthly. After your case is discussed a member of the Committee will contact you with the result of your appeal. This will not be the same Managing Editor who handled your case originally.

No further communication will be entered into after the appeal is heard and the Committee has made their decision.

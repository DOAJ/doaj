DOAJ would not be able to do the work that we do without our volunteers. We are very grateful for the work that our volunteers do to help us review applications for journals to be included in DOAJ. With their consent, we have published the names of our team of volunteers below, in recognition of their support for DOAJ and the open access community.
DOAJ volunteers come from all over the world and speak many languages. Occasionally we may put out a call for more volunteers, often when we need help in specific languages.

Follow [our blog](https://blog.doaj.org/) or our [Twitter feed](http://twitter.com/doajplus) to be alerted when the next call for volunteers is published.

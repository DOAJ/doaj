Since 2016 DOAJ has been proud to work with a group of Ambassadors who share our belief that open access is the way forward in scholarly publishing. Our Ambassador program focuses especially on areas of the world where greater awareness of the issues surrounding open access is needed, or where open access journals from the region are under-represented in DOAJ.

Initially working with 12 Ambassadors for the Global South, as part of a project funded by the International Development Research Centre (IDRC), we continued and extended the reach of this program by appointing Ambassadors in Russia, Indonesia and Korea. In 2020 we are delighted to have added new Ambassadors in North America and Japan.

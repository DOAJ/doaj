**Journals do not need to meet the Seal criteria to be accepted into DOAJ.**

There are extra criteria which may make the journal eligible for the DOAJ Seal for best practice. The Seal is awarded to journals that meet additional best practice recommendations based on seven criteria relating to accessibility, openness, discoverability, reuse, and authors rights.

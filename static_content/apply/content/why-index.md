### Four reasons why being indexed in DOAJ matters

{:.numbered-table .numbered-table--labels}
|   | Inclusion in the world’s most important open access service | DOAJ is the [most important community-driven, open access service in the world](http://repository.jisc.ac.uk/6269/10/final-KE-Report-V5.1-20JAN2016.pdf). DOAJ indexes more than 14 500 open access journals from 133 countries, in 77 languages, and over 300 subject areas. All journals are reviewed by our team of staff and volunteer editors to ensure they meet a set of quality standards. |
|   | Adherence to standards                                          | The [DOAJ criteria](/apply/guide/) have become the accepted way of measuring an open access journal’s adherence to standards in academic publishing.                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |
|   | Access to funding                                               | Open access publication funds often require authors to publish in journals that are indexed in DOAJ.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |
|   | Compliance with publishing initiatives                            | Certification in DOAJ makes your journal compliant with initiatives such as [Plan S](https://www.coalition-s.org/).                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |

{:.numbered-table .numbered-table--labels}
|   | Service               | We help you to serve your authors better.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |
|   | Best practice             | We will help you adopt a range of ethical and quality standards, making your journals more attractive publishing channels. <br>DOAJ is tackling the problems of unethical practice head-on and is fully engaged and committed to combatting questionable publishers and questionable publishing practices, helping to protect researchers from becoming trapped by these journals.                     |
|   | International support | We operate globally via a network of Ambassadors and volunteers, so we can usually offer local support in your language.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |
|   | Visibility       | Indexing your journal in DOAJ increases traffic to it and visibility of your published content. <br>Levels of traffic to a journal website typically increase threefold after inclusion in DOAJ. <br>Your journal will have more exposure worldwide. <br>Your journal website’s indexing in search engines, such as Google, will improve.                                                              |
|   | Discoverability        | DOAJ metadata is free for anyone to use which means it is incorporated into search engines and discovery services. It is then propagated across the Internet. <br>If you provide us with article metadata for your journal, this will be supplied to all the major aggregators, and many research organisations and university library portals who use our widgets, RSS feeds, API and other services. |

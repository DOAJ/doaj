Dear publisher,

The journal {{ journal_name }} has now been added to DOAJ.
You may access the journal in your Publisher Area: {{ url_root }}/publisher/ .
You will need your username and password.
If you do not already have a DOAJ account, you will receive more information in a separate email. (If you do not have your username or the instructions to set your password then please contact us: {{ url_root }}/contact .)

To increase the visibility, impact, distribution and usage* of your journal, we urge you to upload the journal's article metadata to us. You may do this from the Publisher Area in two ways:

1) Upload Article XML: {{ url_root }}/publisher/uploadfile
You must log into your account first. You may either upload XML to DOAJ or provide us with a URL from where we can download it. All XML files uploaded to DOAJ must conform to the DOAJ Native XML schema: {{ url_root }}/static/doaj/doajArticles.xsd. New articles will appear on the site after 1 hour. If there are problems with your file, an error message will be displayed. Correct the error and reupload the file.
Find out more about the XML file structure here: {{ url_root }}/features in the section "File upload info"
If you need further help with XML, we recommend you do a search online as there are many resources available.

2) Enter Article Metadata: {{ url_root }}/publisher/metadata
You may enter article metadata manually. You will need to complete the form for each article. If you make a mistake, re-enter the metadata again and the new file will overwrite the old one. New articles will appear on the site immediately.

If you are adding content to an existing issue, you only need to supply the latest content to us. DOAJ does not accept PDFs.

You can check that your articles have been successfully added to your journal by going to 'Your Journals' in the 'Publisher Area' and clicking the journal title.

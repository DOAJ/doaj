Dear publisher

There was a problem processing your reapplications uploaded on {{when}}.

Your CSV upload for your reapplications has failed. This can happen for the following reasons:

1) You have modified one or more of the ISSNs in the first row of the file.
2) You have added a new column and ISSN to the file that was not in the CSV when you downloaded it.
3) The list of questions in Column A of the CSV file has been modified
4) You have tried to upload a file that is not a .csv file. We can only accept the .csv format.
5) You have tried to upload a file that is not in the Unicode UTF8 format.

Log back into your DOAJ Publisher Area and check the 'Status of uploaded reapplications' section.

{% if publisher_name %}Dear {{ publisher_name }},{% endif %}

The update which you submitted for "{{ bibjson.title }}" on {{ application.date_applied|human_date }} has been rejected. This is either because:

- we were unable to verify the information which you provided with the information stated on your website. Please double check your website and submit a new update when you are ready; or
- we already have one active update in the system. Additional updates are rejected without review.

If you have any questions about this or require further details, please contact our Help Desk: feedback@doaj.org.

Yours faithfully,

The DOAJ Editorial Team

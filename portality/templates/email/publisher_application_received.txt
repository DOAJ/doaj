We have received your application.

DOAJ receives hundreds of applications every month. We will review yours as soon as we can. You will receive an email from us when the review is complete or if we have questions about your application.

If you need to make a change to your application, send an email to feedback@doaj.org. You must include your ISSN.

We cannot reply to emails requesting a status update for applications which are less than three months old.

If you write to us, check first that there is nothing in your spam folder from us or one of our volunteers. Our volunteers may not be emailing from a DOAJ email address: check that their name is here https://doaj.org/volunteers.

Yours faithfully,

The DOAJ Editorial Team

<h2>Journal Reapplication Form</h2>

<p>Use this form to update your existing journal in the DOAJ, and to provide us with the new information that is required.</p>

<p>We provide some <a href="{{ url_for('doaj.faq', _anchor='procedure') }}">guidance on the information we are looking for</a> but
that list is by no means exhaustive. Applicants are simply encouraged to complete the form clearly and honestly. If you
do not know the answer to a question, you can request help by contacting us.</p>

<p>Guides to completing the form are available in <a href="{{ url_for('doaj.translated') }}">other
languages</a>.</p>

        <h3>A note about the qualifiers for the DOAJ Seal</h3>
        <p>DOAJ promotes best practice in Open Access publishing. To that end, we are introducing the DOAJ Seal for Open Access journals.</p>

        <p>The qualifiers for the Seal will highlight features related to the openness, indexability and discoverability of the journal and, as such, have nothing to do with <strong>the scholarly quality of the papers published in the journal</strong>.</p>

        <p>To qualify for the Seal the journal must:</p>
        <ol>
            <li>have an archival arrangement in place with an external party. <a class="animated" href="#digital_archiving_policy-container">(scroll to digital archiving policy question)</a> If 'No policy in place' is selected, the journal will not qualify for the Seal.</li>
            <li>provide permanent identifiers in the papers published. <a class="animated" href="#article_identifiers-container">(scroll to article identifiers question)</a> If 'None' is selected, the journal will not qualify for the Seal.</li>
            <li>provide article level metadata to DOAJ. <a class="animated" href="#metadata_provision-container">(scroll to metadata provision question)</a> If 'No' is selected or the journal fails to provide metadata within 3 months, the journal will not qualify for the Seal.</li>
            <li>embed machine-readable CC licensing information in its article level metadata. <a class="animated" href="#license_embedded-container">(scroll to embedded licensing data question)</a> If 'No' is selected the journal will not qualify for the Seal.</li>
            <li>allow reuse and remixing of its content in accordance with a CC BY, CC BY-SA or CC BY-NC. <a class="animated" href="#license-container">(scroll to licensing question)</a> If CC BY-ND, 'No' or 'Other' is selected the journal will not qualify for the Seal.</li>
            <li>have a deposit policy registered in a deposit policy directory. <a class="animated" href="#deposit_policy-container">(scroll to deposit policy question)</a> If 'No' is selected the journal will not qualify for the Seal.</li>
        </ol>

        <p>A journal cannot apply for the Seal. The Seal will be awarded to a journal by the DOAJ Editorial staff depending on the information provided in the application form.</p>

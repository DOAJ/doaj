                        <p>This is the current version of the DOAJ API</p>
                        <p>Please review the below timeline and migration notes, and upgrade your integrations
                        as soon as possible.</p>

                        <p>Documentation for the previous version of the API (v3) is available <a href="{{ url_for("api_v3.docs") }}">here</a></p>

                        <p>This new version of the API introduces significant performance improvements on the bulk article upload endpoint (/api/bulk/articles).</p>

                        <p>This change is not backwards compatible with the previous API version, so if you rely on bulk article uploads, you will need to upgrade your integrations to use the new version.</p>

                        <p>This upgrade affects only the /api/bulk/articles endpoint. If you do not use this feature, your API integrations will continue to work normally.</p>

                        <p>The bulk articles endpoint has changed from a synchronous upload to an asynchronous one. In this new version, you upload a batch of articles to be ingested, and the system will respond immediately with an "Accepted" response, and a link to a status endpoint which will track the import progress of your request. This has been done for several reasons:</p>
                        <ul style="margin-left: 0.75rem !important">
                            <li>It is consistent with the manual bulk upload approach we have in the user interface</li>
                            <li>It allows us to manage the performance of the API better</li>
                            <li>It mitigates issues some users have had with large uploads timing out</li>
                        </ul>

                        <h2>Timeline</h2>
                        <ol style="margin-left: 0.75rem !important; list-style: auto">
                            <li><strong>18th July 2024</strong> The v4 API became the "current" API version and is available at /api AND /api/v4. At this point, old integrations with the bulk article upload have ceased to work, and you must switch to using /api/v3 if you want to get it to work again. If you wish to continue using this feature long-term, you must upgrade your integrations.</li>

                            <li><strong>Early 2025</strong> (exact date to be confirmed) All previous API versions (v1, v2 and v3) will cease to support bulk article uploads, and if you wish to use this feature, you must use the v4 API. All other backwards-compatible API features in those previous versions of the API will continue to work as normal.</li>

                        </ol>

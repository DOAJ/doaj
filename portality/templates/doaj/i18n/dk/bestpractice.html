<h2>Principles of Transparency and Best Practice in Scholarly Publishing</h2>

    {% include 'doaj/_bestpractice_nav.html' %}

<p><b>Introduction</b></p>

<p>The <a href="https://publicationethics.org/">Committee on Publication Ethics</a>, the Directory of Open Access 
Journals, the <a href="https://oaspa.org/">Open Access Scholarly Publishers Association</a> and the 
<a href="http://www.wame.org">World Association of Medical Editors</a> are scholarly organizations that have 
seen an increase in the number, and broad range in the quality of, membership applications. Our organizations 
have collaborated to identify principles of transparency and best practice for scholarly publications and to clarify that these 
principles form the basis of the criteria by which suitability for membership is assessed by COPE, DOAJ and OASPA, and part of the 
criteria on which membership applications are evaluated by WAME. Each organization also has their own, additional criteria which are 
used when evaluating applications. The organizations will not share lists of publishers or journals that failed to demonstrate that 
they met the criteria for transparency and best practice.</p>

<p>This is the third version of a work in progress (published January 2018); the first version was made available by OASPA in 
December 2013 and a second version in June 2015. We encourage its wide dissemination and continue to welcome feedback on the general 
principles and the specific criteria. Background on the organizations is below.</p>

<p>An infographic of these Principles was commissioned by COPE and is available to download here:

<p><b>Principles of Transparency</b></p>
<p>
	<ol>
		<li><b>Website</b></br>
		A journal's website, including the text that it contains, shall demonstrate that care has been taken to ensure high 
		ethical and professional standards. It must not contain information that might mislead readers or authors, including 
		any attempt to mimic another journal/publisherâ€™s site.</br>
		An 'Aims & Scope' statement should be included on the website and the readership clearly defined. There should be a 
		statement on what a journal will consider for publication including authorship criteria (e.g. not considering multiple 
		submissions, redundant publications) to be included. ISSNs should be clearly displayed (separate for print and 
		electronic).</li>

		<li><b>Name of journal</b></br>
		The Journal name shall be unique and not be one that is easily confused with another journal or that might mislead potential 
		authors and readers about the Journal's origin or association with other journals.</li>
		
		<li><b>Peer review process</b></br>
		Journal content must be clearly marked as whether peer reviewed or not. Peer review is defined as obtaining
		advice on individual manuscripts from reviewers expert in the field who are not part of the journal's 
		editorial staff. This process, as well as any policies related to the journal's peer review procedures,
		shall be clearly described on the journal's Web site, including the method of peer review used. Journal websites 
		should not guarantee manuscript acceptance or very short peer review times.</li>

		<li><b>Ownership and management</b></br>
		Information about the ownership and/or management of a journal shall be clearly indicated on the journal's website. 
		Publishers shall not use organizational or journal names that would mislead potential authors and editors about the 
		nature of the journal's owner.</li>
		
		<li><b>Governing body</b></br>
		Journals shall have editorial boards or other governing bodies whose members are recognized experts in the 
		subject areas included within the journal's scope. The full names and affiliations of the journal's editorial board or 
		other governing body shall be provided on the journal's website.</li>
		
		<li><b>Editorial team/contact information</b></br>
		Journals shall provide the full names and affiliations of the journal's editors on the journal's website as 
		well as contact information for the editorial office, including a full address.</li>

		<li><b>Copyright and Licensing</b></br>
		The policy for copyright shall be clearly stated in the author guidelines and the copyright holder named on all published 
		articles. Likewise, licensing information shall be clearly described in guidelines on the website, and licensing terms
		shall be indicated on all published articles, both HTML and PDFs. If authors are allowed to publish under a Creative 
		Commons license then any specific license requirements shall be noted. Any policies on posting of final accepted 
		versions or published articles on third party repositories shall be clearly stated.</li>
		
		<li><b>Author fees</b></br>
		Any fees or charges that are required for manuscript processing and/or publishing materials in the journal shall 
		be clearly stated in a place that is easy for potential authors to find prior to submitting their manuscripts 
		for review, or explained to authors before they begin preparing their manuscript for submission. If no such fees are 
		charged that should also be clearly stated.</li>
		
		<li><b>Process for identification of and dealing with allegations of research misconduct</b></br>
		Publishers and editors shall take reasonable steps to identify and prevent the publication of papers where 
		research misconduct has occurred, including plagiarism, citation manipulation, and data falsification/fabrication,
		among others. In no case shall a journal or its editors encourage such misconduct, or knowingly allow such 
		misconduct to take place. In the event that a journal's publisher or editors are made aware of any allegation
		of research misconduct relating to a published article in their journal, the publisher or editor shall follow 
		<a href="https://publicationethics.org/resources/guidelines">COPE's guidelines</a> (or equivalent) in dealing 
		with allegations.</li>

		<li><b>Publication Ethics</b></br>
		A journal shall also have policies on publishing ethics. These should be clearly visible on its website, and should 
		refer to: i) Journal policies on authorship and contributorship; ii) How the journal will handle complaints and appeals;
		iii) Journal policies on conflicts of interest / competing interests; iv) Journal policies on data sharing and 
		reproducibility; v) Journal's policy on ethical oversight; vi) Journal's policy on intellectual property; and vii) 
		Journal's options for post-publication discussions and corrections.</li>
		
		<li><b>Publishing schedule</b></br>
		The periodicity at which a journal publishes shall be clearly indicated.</li>
		
		<li><b>Access</b></br>
		The way(s) in which the journal and individual articles are available to readers and whether there are associated 
		subscription or pay per view fees shall be stated.</li>
		
		<li><b>Archiving</b></br>
		A journal's plan for electronic backup and preservation of access to the journal content (for example, access to main 
		articles via CLOCKSS or PubMedCentral) in the event a journal is no longer published shall be clearly indicated.</li>
		
		<li><b>Revenue sources</b></br>
		Business models or revenue sources (eg, author fees, subscriptions, advertising, reprints, institutional 
		support, and organizational support) shall be clearly stated or otherwise evident on the journal's website. Publishing 
		fees or waiver status should not influence editorial decision making.</li>
		
		<li><b>Advertising</b></br>
		Journals shall state their advertising policy if relevant, including what types of adverts will be considered, who 
		makes decisions regarding accepting adverts and whether they are linked to content or reader behavior (online only)
		or are displayed at random. Advertisements should not be related in any way to editorial decision making and shall be 
		kept separate from the published content.</li>
		
		<li><b>Direct marketing</b></br>
		Any direct marketing activities, including solicitation of manuscripts that are conducted on behalf of the 
		journal, shall be appropriate, well targeted, and unobtrusive.  Information provided about the publisher or journal is
		expected to be truthful and not misleading for readers or authors.</li>
		</p>
		
<p>In the event that a member organization is found to have violated these best practices, or other specific requirements of the 
organisation, OASPA/DOAJ/COPE/WAME shall in the first instance try to work with them in order to address any concerns that have
been raised. In the event that the member organization is unable or unwilling to address these concerns, their membership in 
the organization may be suspended or terminated.</p>

<p>OASPA/DOAJ/COPE/WAME have procedures for dealing with concerns raised about members.</p>

<h3><a name="aimscope"></a>Aims & Scope</h3>

<p>The aim of the DOAJ is to increase the visibility and ease of use of open access scientific and scholarly journals, 
thereby promoting their increased usage and impact. The DOAJ aims to be comprehensive and cover all open access 
scientific and scholarly journals that use a quality control system to guarantee the content. In short, the DOAJ aims 
to be the one-stop shop for users of open access journals.</p>

<p> </p>

<h3><a name="definitions"></a>Definitions</h3>

<p><b>Open Access Journal</b>: We define open access journals as journals that use a funding model that does not charge 
readers or their institutions for access. From the BOAI definition <sup>[1]</sup> of "open access", we support the 
rights of users to "read, download, copy, distribute, print, search, or link to the full texts of these articles" as 
mandatory for a journal to be included in the directory.</p>

<a href="http://www.earlham.edu/~peters/fos/boaifaq.htm#openaccess" target="_blank">http://www.earlham.edu/~peters/fos/boaifaq.htm#openaccess</a></p>

<p><b>Quality Control System:</b> The journal must exercise peer-review or editorial review (particularly in the Humanities), led by an editor, or an editor and an editorial board.</p>

<p><b>Research Journal:</b> Journals that report primary results of research or overviews of research results to a 
scholarly community.</p>

<p><b>Periodical:</b> A serial appearing, or intending to appear, indefinitely at regular intervals and generally more 
frequently than annually, each issue of which is numbered or dated consecutively and normally contains separate 
articles, stories, or other writings.</p>

<p> </p>

<h3><a name="background"></a>Project Background</h3>

The proliferation of freely accessible online journals, the development of subject specific pre- and e-print archives 
and collections of learning objects provides a very valuable supplement of scientific knowledge to the existing types 
of published scientific information (books, journals, databases etc.). However these valuable collections are difficult
to overview and integrate in the library and information services provided by libraries for their user constituency. 

<br><br>

At the First Nordic Conference on Scholarly Communication in Lund/Copenhagen (http://www.lub.lu.se/ncsc2002) the idea 
of creating a comprehensive directory of Open Access Journals was discussed. The conclusion was that it would be a 
valuable service for the global research and education community. <a href="http://www.soros.org/" target="_blank">Open
Society Institute</a> (OSI) supported the initial project work.

<br><br>

<p>Available technologies make it possible to collect and organize these resources in a way that allow libraries 
worldwide to integrate these resources in existing services thus offering added value both for the service providers 
of these resources and for the global research and education community.</p>

<h3><a name="europeana"></a>Participant in the Europeana  Libraries Project</h3>

<p>DOAJ participated in the Europeana Libraries project 2010-2012. DOAJ is included in the portal which was launched 
in Tartu, Estonia on June 27, 2012. Offering <a href="http://www.theeuropeanlibrary.org" target="_blank">free online 
access to high quality full text content, plus excellent search tools, the portal</a> enables researchers to find, use 
and re-use a vast range of materials with ease. The content of DOAJ will be even more visible and disseminated through 
this portal.</p>

<p>A promotional video for the website can also be viewed on their 
<a href="http://www.youtube.com/user/theeuropeanlibrary" target="_blank">YouTube channel</a>. </p>

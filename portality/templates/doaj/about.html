<p>The DOAJ (Directory of Open Access Journals) was launched in 2003 at Lund University, Sweden, with 300 open access journals.
Today, the independent database contains ca. 12000 open access journals covering all areas of science, technology, medicine, 
social science and humanities.</p>

<p>DOAJ is a membership organisation and membership is available in 3 main categories: 
<a href="{{ url_for('doaj.publishermembers') }}">Publisher</a>, <a href="{{ url_for('doaj.members') }}">Ordinary Member
</a> and <a href="{{ url_for('doaj.sponsors') }}">Sponsor</a>. A DOAJ Membership is a clear statement of intent and 
proves a commitment to quality, peer-reviewed open access. DOAJ is co-author to the 
<a href="{{ url_for('doaj.bestpractice') }}">Principles of Transparency and Best Practice in Scholarly Publishing
(Principles)</a> and DOAJ members are expected to follow these principles as a condition of membership. DOAJ reserves the 
right to reject applications for membership, or revoke membership if a member or sponsor is found to contravene the 
Principles. <a href="{{ url_for('doaj.membership') }}">Read more about membership here</a>.</p>

<p>DOAJ is a community-curated list of open access journals and aims to be the starting point for all information searches for 
quality, peer reviewed open access material. To assist libraries and indexers keep their lists up-to-date, we make 
public a list of journals that have been <a href="http://bit.ly/1IOA9AJ">accepted into or removed from</a> DOAJ but we 
will not discuss specific details of an application with anyone apart from the applicant. Neither will we discuss individual
publishers or applications with members of the public unless we believe that, by doing so, we will be making a positive
contribution to the open access community.</p>

<p>DOAJ publishes <a href="{{ url_for('doaj.publishers') }}">Information for Publishers</a> on this site to help
Publishers adhere to the Principles and to assist them in completing 
<a href="{{ url_for('doaj.suggestion') }}">an application</a>. DOAJ also publishes 
<a href="{{ url_for('doaj.faq') }}">a list of FAQs</a> relevant to all members of the publishing community, 
particularly libraries and authors. All information on this site is available to both members and non-members.</p>

<p> </p>

<h3><a id="aimscope"></a>DOAJ's Mission</h3>

<p>DOAJ's mission is to increase the visibility, accessibility, reputation, usage and impact of quality, peer-reviewed, open access 
    scholarly research journals globally, regardless of discipline, geography or language. DOAJ will work with editors, publishers and 
    journal owners to help them understand the value of best practice publishing and standards and apply those to their own operations.
    DOAJ is committed to being 100% independent and maintaining all of its services and metadata as free to use or reuse for everyone.</p>

<p> </p>

<h3><a id="constitution"></a>Constitution</h3>

<p>DOAJ is a not-for-profit organisation managed by <a href="http://is4oa.org/">Infrastructure Services for Open Access
C.I.C.</a> (Community Interest Company) based in the United Kingdom. DOAJ relies entirely on the voluntary donations 
of its members and on sponsorship monies received.  In March 2016, DOAJ received
<a href="https://doajournals.wordpress.com/2016/03/22/idrc-grant-to-improve-oa-journals-from-the-global-south/">a grant from the IDRC</a>
for a specific timed project tackling the improvement of open access journals in the Global South. Neither DOAJ or IS4OA receives grants or 
funding from any other source.</p>

<p>DOAJ has <a href="#board">an Advisory Board</a> and <a href="#council">a Council</a>, the members of which carry out their duties voluntarily.</p>

<p>DOAJ uses the services of approximately 100 voluntary editorial staff who review applications. Volunteers are 
bound by a Code of Conduct and an Agreement that they must sign and return to DOAJ before they can carry out their 
duties. At least two references are requested from everyone who volunteers and all volunteers are bound by the Code of 
Conduct to declare any conflicts of interest to the Managing Editors.</p>

<h3><a name="pubmem"></a>1) How to become a Publisher Member</h3>
<p>
<b>Support DOAJ and make a financial contribution</b>
<br>
DOAJ relies entirely on voluntary donations from the community. We urge you to become a
<a href="{{ url_for('doaj.support') }}">Publisher Member</a>, showing your support for DOAJ and for open access in general.
Publisher members may carry the DOAJ logo on their site to show their support.
Becoming a Publisher Member does not guarantee that your journals will be included in the DOAJ. 
<br><br>

<!-- SECTION ADVICE -->

<h3><a name="advice"></a>2) Some publishing advice for Open Access publishers</h3>
<p><b>One URL for each journal, one PDF for each article</b></p>
<p>When a journal gets indexed it will have its own record in the directory.</p>
<p>To make our service comprehensible and user-friendly, the link from the directory must go to the URL for the
specific journal and not to a collection of journals.</p>
<p>Please note that all necessary information (by 'necessary information', we are referring to the journal's aims
and scope, the clear presence of the editorial board, the author guidelines, the description of the quality control
system and the Open Access statement) about the specific journal should be available at its own URL to make it
easier for users to interpret the information correctly.</p>
<p>We strongly recommend that your content is available article by article, one PDF for each article, and not
one PDF per issue. This has multiple advantages, such as direct linking to articles, promotes findability, easier
to navigate, read and download. When article metadata is uploaded to DOAJ, it should have a unique URL.</p>
<p>We strongly recommend that your content is preserved in a digital preservation or archiving service, sometimes
referred to as Long Term Preservation and Archiving (LTPA).
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_digital_preservation_initiatives">You can find a list some of these services
here.</a></p>
<p>Please also read <!-- the <a href="">Online Guide to Open Access Journals Publishing</a>
and --> <a href="http://oaspa.org/membership/code-of-conduct/">OASPA's Code of Conduct</a> for more information.</p>
<br><br>
<p><b>Knowledge organization, commercials and ads</b></p>
<p>Please pay attention to the fact that having a clear structure when organizing your material makes it easier for
users to navigate between articles.</p>
<p>Preferably articles will be gathered in volumes, marked with the year the articles were published, making it easier
for scholars to cite them (and readers to find them).</p>
<p>If publishing different types of articles (for example original articles, review articles, case studies, essays or
book reviews) please note that it is advantageous to display articles of the same type together in each volume and to
mark each article with the specific article type.</p>
<p>If you find it necessary to have commercials or banner advertising on your journal's web site(s), make sure that
the ad is not in any way offensive and doesn't include information that could decrease the credibility of your
journal.</p>
<p>Blinking and/or moving objects will distract a reader and make your web site difficult to "read". This is
discouraged.</p>
<p>Keep in mind that, in the long run, articles that are not clearly organised and/or too many
commercials/ads/blinking or moving objects will decrease the usage of your web site.</p>
<br><br>
<p><b>Impact Factors</b></p>
<p>DOAJ does not condone the use of impact factors; does not recognise partial impact factors, and advocates any
official, alternative measure of use, such as article level metrics. There is only one official, universally
recognised impact factor that is generated by Thomson Reuters; it is a proprietary measure run by a profit making
organisation. It runs against the ethics and principles of open access.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, there are many fake impact factor services now purporting to offer impact factors for new journals.
These fake impact factors come at a price and an impact factor on any journal homepage should be researched
carefully. DO NOT submit papers to a journal based on its impact factor alone.</p>
<br><br>
<p><b>Transparent editorial boards</b></p>
<p>We believe that it increases the trustworthiness and credibility of a journal if the reader is able to find/contact the editor or members of the editorial board. For this reason we encourage you to be as transparent as possible when presenting your Editorial Board. Information of public interest is:
<ul>
<li>The affiliation of the editorial board members;</li>
<li>The contact addresses of the editorial board members;</li>
<li>If possible, we recommend you to add a link to the web site where the specific editorial board member is presented by his or her employing institution.</li>
</ul>
</p>
<br><br>
<p><b>Quality control and author guidelines</b></p>
<p>To assure readers and potential authors that articles go through a quality control system before publication, we strongly recommend that you describe the process clearly on the web site.</p>
<p>Since Open Access is still a relatively young way of publishing research papers and scholarly materials, we believe that it is important to show that open access journals have the same, rigorous quality control systems as printed and subscription based journals.</p>
<p>Having detailed and comprehensive guidelines for authors is a good way of helping potential contributors and saves you time since it can prevent a lot of unnecessary paperwork and manuscript resubmissions.</p>
<p>We recommend all journals have author guidelines (Instructions for authors) and that the following are included:
<ul>
<li>A detailed style guide;</li>
<li>A description of the quality control processes;</li>
<li>If the journal charges authors or authors' institutions any handling fees, publication fees or similar, the amount should be clearly stated;</li>
<li>Information about copyright (please note the importance of informing authors about whether the journal will be the copyright holder after publication of an article or if the copyright remains with the author(s). We strongly believe that authors should be informed about your copyright/licensing conditions before they submit their work);</li>
<li>Description of how to submit an article;</li>
<li>A contact email address.</li>
</ul>
</p>
<br><br>
<p><b>Statement about Open Access and copyright</b></p>
<p>Since DOAJ is a collection of Open Access journals and articles, we strongly recommend that you not only mention but thoroughly describe the journal's Open Access policy on the web site. It should be clearly linked to from the home page.</p>
<p>Clearly stating exactly which rights readers have when they use the material is a way of showing that you are sharing your published material to support a greater global exchange of knowledge. It is also a way of protecting your material from illegal use (for example if you are stating that you prohibit reproduction or commercial use of your articles).</p>
<p>Here is an example of an Open Access statement, fitting our criteria, that could be published on your website:</p>
<blockquote>This is an open access journal which means that all content is freely available without charge to the user or his/her institution. Users are allowed to read, download, copy, distribute, print, search, or link to the full texts of the articles in this journal without asking prior permission from the publisher or the author. This is in accordance with the BOAI definition of open access.</blockquote>
<p>Please take care to identify any possible contradictions between your Open Access policy and your copyright policy.</p>
<br><br>
<p><b>Licensing your material with a CC-license</b></p>
<p>An additional way of showing in which form a journal is Open Access is through licensing it with a Creative Commons license. (Read more about <a href="http://creativecommons.org/about/licenses">the different forms of licenses</a>.)</p>
<p>Such licensing is very beneficial for authors since it shows, for example, if there are any limits in creating derivative works.</p>
<p>If licensing old material, please make sure that your journal has the copyright permission of the published material. If you do not, you have to ask the original copyright holder for permission before licensing the articles. (More information can be found at the <a href="http://wiki.creativecommons.org/Before_Licensing">Creative Commons web site</a>.)</p>
<br><br>
<p><b>Questions</b></p>
<p>If you have any questions on the content above or need advice on how to improve your web site to make it fit our selection criteria, please do not hesitate to <a href="/contact">contact us</a>.


<!-- SECTION APPLYING -->

<h3><a name="applying"></a>3) Applying for your journal to be in DOAJ</h3>
<p>For a journal to be included in DOAJ, it must go through the application process. Due to the nature of the
information that we require, only publishers or editors should attempt to complete the application form.</p>
<p>An application is detailed and it will take time. You are required to collect all
the necessary information and read the following information before you start: 
<a href="#definition">some definitions</a>, <a href="#standards">some basic 
standards</a>, <a href="#procedure">the application process</a>. You cannot save your progress in the form at 
this time.</p>
<p>The new application form has been extended in a way that requires applicants to provide a lot more information 
upfront, and to clearly state that information on their sites. This will help the DOAJ team to make a comprehensive 
assessment of the journal's quality and dedication to Open Access. Each journal application will be assessed by 
three different members of the DOAJ Team. Each of the answers provided is verified manually and this important 
process takes time. We therefore ask you not to chase journal applications that were made less than 3 months ago. 
Unfortunately, emails sent about applications that are less than 3 months old will not be answered.</p>
<p>Please note: DO NOT submit your application more than once. Duplicate applications are automatically 
rejected.</p>
<br><br>


<!-- SECTION UPLOADING XML -->

<h3><a name="upload"></a>4) Uploading metadata to DOAJ</h3>
<p>There are now three ways to get your metadata in to DOAJ. You must <a href="/account/login">log in to your
account</a> before uploading metadata. The Publishers' Area now includes a 'Your Journals' tab which has a list of
all your journals currently included in DOAJ <b>and</b> that are associated with your account. You may only upload
metadata to those journals. If you upload metadata which is incorrect (for example contains an ISSN that is not in
the journal list) the upload will be rejected. (Note that you should ensure that your journal record is up-to-date
in DOAJ before you upload metadata to us. If you need to update a journal record, please
<a href="{{ url_for('doaj.contact') }}">contact us</a>.)</p>
<p>The ways to get your metadata into DOAJ are:</p>
<ul>
<li><b>Manually enter the metadata article by article.</b> You are able to manually add your article metadata by
filling in the form under the 'Enter Article Metadata' tab. Metadata uploaded this way will be checked for error and
then published to the site every hour. DO NOT use formatting. We only accept plain text.</li>
<li><b>Upload article XML.</b> You are able to upload XML files to us in TWO ways. You can either upload the file
manually by selecting it from your computer OR you can enter the URL where the DOAJ site should go to look for the
file.
<br><br>
All uploaded files will be checked immediately for errors. Once they have parsed successfully, they will be
published to the site by an automated script that runs every hour.</li>
</ul>
<p>For help with creating DOAJ XML and details on XML tags, read the
<a href="{{ url_for('doaj.features', _anchor='xml_upload') }}">File Upload Info section</a>
on our Features pages.</p>
<br><br>

<!-- SECTION FAILED UPLOADS -->

<h3><a name="failed"></a>5) Failed XML uploads</h3>
<p>Below are some common reasons for failed xml uploads:</p>
<ul>
<li><b>You are trying to upload XML to the wrong account.</b> You can only upload XML for the journals that appear in
the list under 'Your Journals' in the publisher area. If you have more than one account and you would like to merge
them, please contact us and we will inform you of the process for merging accounts.</li>
<li><b>You are trying to upload a file that is not XML.</b> We can only accept XML. Do not try to upload PDFs to us as
these will be rejected.</li>
<li><b>The ISSN information in the metadata that you are trying to upload does not match what is in the journal record on
DOAJ.</b> For an upload to be successful, the ISSN(s) provided in the metadata must match precisely the ISSN(s) that we
hold on record. A journal may have two ISSNs: an ISSN for the print version and an ISSN for the electronic version.
Sometimes the DOAJ record only holds one ISSN on file and needs to be updated, or the ISSNs of the journal have changed.
Similarly, if the DOAJ record has two ISSNs listed but only one is presented in the XML, a fail will occur. If you
need to have the ISSNs of your DOAJ record updated, please <a href="/contact">contact us</a> and we will check that the
ISSNs are registered at www.issn.org and will then update the record accordingly.</li>
<li><b>The XML is missing a required tag.</b> Sometimes a publisher will try to upload XML to DOAJ that is missing a
specific tag, such as [publicationDate]. You can see exactly
<a href="{{ url_for('doaj.features', _anchor='xml_upload') }}">which tags are required here</a>. If you are having
difficulty with your XML file, there are plenty of resources online where you can check the validity of your XML file.
We are unable to provide specific XML advice. If you are trying to upload a file that was automatically generated by the
OJS DOAJ plugin, then you should first contact OJS for help.</li>
<li><b>The XML is not formatted to the correct .xsd file.</b> The xsd file for DOAJ is here:
https://doaj.org/static/doaj/doajArticles.xsd. All XML files uploaded to DOAJ must reference this xsd file and validate
against it.</li>
<li><b>The XML file contains characters not recognised in the XML language.</b> Sometimes, special characters, especially
those in scientific articles are submitted in the wrong format. XML does not support many special characters but those
that it does can be
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_XML_and_HTML_character_entity_references#Predefined_entities_in_XML">found
on Wikipedia</a>.</li>
</ul>
<p>If you have any questions, please <a href="/contact">contact us</a>.</p>
<br><br>

<!-- SECTION CORRECTING METADATA -->

<h3><a name="correct"></a>6) How do I correct an error in article metadata?</h3>
<p>If you need to correct an error, you must upload the metadata again. To make sure that your new upload overwrites
the old one, at least one piece of key metadata in the new file must match the same piece of metadata in the old file.
The 2 specific pieces of key metadata that we look for are, in priority order:</p>
<ol>
<li><b>DOI</b> - if you assign DOIs to your articles then we will match on the DOI.</li>
<li><b>Full Text URL</b> - this is the URL that you give us for the full text of the article.</li>
</ol>
<p>If there is no DOI, the script will look for the Full Text URL.</p>
<p><b>Some examples</b></p>
<p>Use case 1: a publisher wants to correct some article metadata because an author is missing. The publisher must
reupload the file. The article's DOI in the XML is the same as on the site so the site automatically overwrites the
older version.<br>
Use case 2: a publisher wants to correct the URL for their full text articles because their site has moved.
The publisher does not use DOIs. The publisher must upload a new version. No automatic overwriting
will happen because no matching can occur so the publisher must contact us so we can remove the older version.</p>

<h3><b><a name="sponsor"></a>How can I support/donate to DOAJ?</b></h3>
<p>We would be delighted if you donate to DOAJ. We rely entirely on contributions. Please read our
<a href="/supportDoaj">Support DOAJ</a> page for further information.</p>
<a href="#top">Back to top</a>
<p></p>
<br><br>

<h3><b><a name="definition"></a>How do we define 'Open Access Journal', 'Quality Control', 'Research Journal' and 'Periodical'?</b></h3>
<p><b>Open Access Journal:</b><br>
We define open access journals as journals that use a funding model that does not charge readers or their institutions for access. From the BOAI definition<sup>[1]</sup> of 'open access' we take the right of users to <b>"read, download, copy, distribute, print, search, or link to the full texts of these articles"</b> as mandatory for a journal to be included in the directory.<br>
[1] <a href="http://www.budapestopenaccessinitiative.org/read">http://www.budapestopenaccessinitiative.org/read</a>
</p>

<p><b>Quality Control:</b><br>
<p>The journal must exercise peer-review or editorial review (particularly in the Humanities), led by an editor, or an editor and an editorial board.</p>
<p><b>Research Journal:</b><br>
<p>Journals that report primary results of research or overviews of research results to a scholarly community.</p>
<p><b>Periodical:</b><br>
<p>A serial appearing or intended to appear indefinitely at regular intervals, generally more frequently than annually,
each issue of which is numbered or dated consecutively and normally contains separate articles, stories, or other
writings.</p>
<a href="#top">Back to top</a>
<p></p>
<br><br>
<h3><b><a name="standards"></a>What are the basic standards that a journal must meet for an application to be 
considered?</b></h3>
<p><i>DOAJ adheres to <a href="/bestpractice">the Principles of Transparency and Best Practice in Scholarly 
Publishing</a>, a joint statement published by COPE, DOAJ, OASPA and WAME. We advise that all applicants read through 
this statement before applying.</i></p>

<p>To facilitate a faster response time, applications will be triaged to ensure they meet some basic criteria. 
These are:</p>
<p><b>Coverage:</b><br>
<ul>
<li>Subject: all scientific and scholarly subjects are covered. We use the
<a href="http://www.loc.gov/catdir/cpso/lcco/">Library of Congress Classification Outline</a>.</li>
<li>Types of resource: scientific and scholarly periodicals that publish research or review papers in full text.</li>
<li>Acceptable sources: academic, government, commercial, non-profit and private sources are all acceptable.</li>
<li>Level: the primary target group should be researchers.</li>
<li>Content: a substantive part of the journal should consist of original research and/or reviewpapers. All content 
should be available in full text on the site. See our <a href="#casereport">policy for case report journals</a>. A 
journal must have published at least 5 articles in the last calendar year. New journals may apply and will be reviewed
normally but, should they be accepted, they will not be added to the site until 5 articles have been published.
</li>
<li>All languages are accepted.</li>
</ul>
<p><b>Access:</b><br>
<ul>
<li>The full text of ALL content must be available for free and be Open Access without delay (i.e. no embargo period).</li>
<li>Registration: User registration online is acceptable on the condition that the journal has a proper Privacy Policy
in place and abides by Data Protection rules. That is to say: user data will never be distributed without the
explicit permission of the user; upon request, a user's email address is removed from mailing lists; all data held about
the user will be made available to the user upon request.</li>
</ul>
<p><b>Quality:</b> The journal must exercise quality control on submitted papers using a peer-review system. The 
journal—and the manuscript review process specifically—must have either an editor, or an editor and an editorial board, 
in place. See our <a href="#humanities">policy for Humanities journals</a>.</p>
<p><b>Periodical:</b> The journal must have at least one ISSN (International Standard Serial Number) registered at
<a href="http://www.issn.org">issn.org</a>. In general, if a journal exists in print and online, then it should have both an
ISSN for the print version and an ISSN for the electronic version.</p>
<a href="#top">Back to top</a>
<p></p>
<br><br>

<h3><b><a name="procedure"></a>What is the procedure for a journal being accepted into DOAJ?</b></h3>
<p><b>Application</b></p>
<p>We must receive one application per journal. Once submitted, the application passes through <a href="#standards">
a triage process</a> and is assigned to a DOAJ Associate Editor. Each of the answers provided will be checked and 
verified manually. The things that we will check include but are not limited to:
<ul>
<li>That the journal's ISSN(s) number(s) is registered at issn.org and matches the one provided in the application;</li>
<li>That the title in the application matches what is registered at issn.org and what is stated on the journal's 
web site;</li>
<li>That the country of the publisher in the application matches the country registered at issn.org; 
this may not always be the same as the country where the journal is registered.</li>
<li>That the journal has an editor or an editor and an editorial board with identifiable members; we will contact you 
for members' contact details as part of our review process. These will never be made publicly available.</li>
<li>That the journal executes some form of editorial review or peer review, that this is clearly stated on the web site
and that it matches the answer given in the application form;</li>
<li>That the full text of articles is available on the web site and is free, without embargo, upon publication;</li>
<li>That the journal is open access and that an Open Access policy is clearly stated <b>on the journal's web site</b>
and is easily findable. <b>At a minimum, a journal's policy should match the 
<a href="http://www.budapestopenaccessinitiative.org/read">the BOAI definition</a></b>. By this we mean that the journal's
articles have "free availability on the public internet, permitting any users to read, download, copy, distribute, 
print, search, or link to the full texts of these articles, crawl them for indexing, pass them as data to software,
or use them for any other lawful purpose, without financial, legal, or technical barriers other than those
inseparable from gaining access to the internet itself."</li>
<li>That any fees for publishing in the journal are clearly displayed in a place that is easy to find;
if there are no charges this must also be stated clearly.</li>
<li>That if the journal has any other kind of author charges, they are clearly stated and easily findable on the web
site;</li>
<li>That the language of the full text articles match the language stated in the application.</li>
</ul>
</p>
<p>If the information provided in the
application is unclear or does not match what is on the site, or we think that it is incorrect, we will contact you 
for clarification.</p>

<p><b>Status updates</b><br>
<p>Unfortunately, we are unable to provide status updates for any application that is less than THREE months old.</p>

<p><b>Acceptance into DOAJ</b><br>
<p>Upon acceptance into DOAJ, the journal is classified by the DOAJ team according to the Library of Congress
Classification (LCC) system. An automatic confirmation email is sent to the person listed in Question 9; it contains
details on how to log into your Publisher account. You will need these details to upload article metadata and manage 
your account. A journal becomes visible in DOAJ immediately upon acceptance.</p>
<p><b>Rejection of an Application</b></br>
<p>If your application is rejected, one of our managing editors will let you know why. A rejected journal may reapply 
for inclusion, after 6 months and once it has demonstrated clearly that it has made the improvements suggested by
the managing editor.</p>
<p><b>Uploading or creating metadata in DOAJ</b><br>
<p>We <b><i>strongly</i></b> recommend that ALL journals provide us with <a href="/publisher/uploadfile">article
metadata in XML format</a> or create the data manually using <a href="/publisher/metadata">our metadata entry form</a>. 
DOAJ is <a href="#oai">OAI-PMH</a> compliant and once an article is available in DOAJ it becomes automatically OAI 
harvestable. New articles are published to the site every 30 minutes.</p>

<h3><b><a name="application"></a>Why can't I save my progress when filling out the application form?</b></h3>
<p>It isn't possible to save your Application just yet; it's a feature that we will add in the
future. In the meantime, you could try these two tips to help you keep a record of your application(s):</p>
<ul>
<li>Before you start, print out a version of the form to use as a draft. The form prints best in Google Chrome.</li>
<li>The application form requires a lot of information to be entered into one place. Before you start filling it in,
we recommend that you collect upfront all the information you will require. We have created
<a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheet/ccc?key=0AkfPCpIPjZlmdDJIOHpVcXBleFRZOTRIRW5naVY3Smc&usp=sharing">a
spreadsheet version of the form for you to download and complete offline</a>. For your convenience there are columns for more than one journal but you MUST complete ONE online application per journal.</li>
<li>If you haven't used the spreadsheet to collect your application's information, you can record your answers by taking screenshots of the completed form BEFORE you hit the Submit button.</li>
</ul>

<br><br>

<h3><b><a name="login"></a>How do I log into my account?</b></h3>
<p>Once your journal has been accepted in to DOAJ then you can <a href="http://doaj.org/account/login">log in to your
account</a>. If the journal has been added to a publisher account that already has journals in DOAJ then the login
credentials will be the same: the new journal will have been added to the existing account.</p>
<p>If a new account has been created, an automated email is sent to the contact in Question 9 of the application upon acceptance. The email
contains your username and instructions on how to choose a password. The link is valid for 14 days only. Once you have
logged in to your account, you will see your journal(s) listed in the 'Your Journals' tab.</p>

<h3><b><a name="publisher"></a>How do I upload article metadata to DOAJ?</b></h3>
<p>Once a journal has been accepted in to DOAJ, article metadata may be uploaded as XML or created manually. If the
journal belongs to an existing DOAJ account, then the publisher must <a href="http://doaj.org/account/login">log in to
their account</a> and then add metadata via the <a href="http://doaj.org/publisher/">Publisher Area</a>. For more
information go to the <a href="/publishers">For publishers</a> page and read the 'Uploading Metadata' section there.

<h3><b><a name="update"></a>I have uploaded article metadata to DOAJ but it has not appeared on the site. Has something gone wrong?</b></h3>
<p>If you did not receive any error messages when you uploaded the metadata then it is likely that everything has worked OK. Remember that it may take up to 60 minutes for your articles to appear on the site and up to 12 hours for the tables of contents to show your latest uploads. You can check that the articles have uploaded correctly by doing a search on the full article title in inverted commas " ". If, after 12 hours, you see that the article is on the site but has not attached itself to the Table of Contents then one of two things has gone wrong:</p>
<ul>
<li>The volume and issue values provided are incorrect. Check that each article in the issue has the correct value for both Volume and Issue.</li>
<li>You have not provided a Volume value in your metadata. Tables of contents require a volume value to build the issues correctly. If the volume value is left empty, the articles will not appear on the Table of contents.</li>
<li>The article that you uploaded has been
overwritten by another one. <b>The URL for every article provided must be unique.</b> When a publishers wishes to update an existing article's metadata, we use the full text URL to
match the two versions of the same article . If you have provided the same URL for every article then only the last
article uploaded will appear on the site.</p>

<p>Remember: articles are added to a journal's Tables of Contents over night so you will not see them there immediately.</p>

<p>If, after 24 hours, you still cannot find your article on the site, please <a href="/contact">Contact us</a>.</p>

<h3><b><a name="getlicense"></a>How do I get a Creative Commons license on to my content?</b></h3>
<p>(You may have an equivalent license in your country that is not a CC license. This is perfectly valid for DOAJ.)</p>
<ul>
<li>Choose the most appropriate CC license from the Creative Commons web site—refer to the paragraph below.</li>
<li>We recommend that you apply the CC BY license which is the most user friendly allowing for, among other things,
long-term preservation and text- and data-mining.</li>
<li>If you have different licenses for different articles within the same journal, only the most restrictive can be displayed on the
journal in DOAJ.</li>
</ul>
<p>How to choose the CC BY license:</p>
<p>Go to the Creative Commons (CC) web site <a href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/">
(http://creativecommons.org/licenses/)</a> and copy the CC BY icon - you can also consult this:
<a href="http://wiki.creativecommons.org/Before_Licensing">http://wiki.creativecommons.org/Before_Licensing .</a>
</p>
<p>Put the CC BY icon on the homepage of your journal(s) and on EVERY article.
<a href="http://wiki.creativecommons.org/Marking_your_work_with_a_CC_license">Read how</a>. Best Practice recommends that the
license metadata is machine readable that is to say: embedded in the HTML, XML or in the PDF metadata.</p>

<br><br>

<h3><b><a name="license"></a>How do I know which CC license to choose?</b></h3>
<p>You can find information on the different types of licenses at the Creative Commons web site:
<a href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/">http://creativecommons.org/licenses/</a> and there is even a page
to help you choose the correct license for your content: <a href="http://creativecommons.org/choose/">
http://creativecommons.org/choose/</a>.</p>
<p>Both pages are available in 24 different languages.</p>

<br><br>

<h3><b><a name="embed"></a>How do I know if my license information is embedded in the metadata?</b></h3>
<p>When applying for a journal to be included in DOAJ, one of the questions asks whether or not you have
machine-readable licensing information embedded in your article metadata. There are
<a href="http://wiki.creativecommons.org/Ccrel">guidelines on the Creative Commons</a> web site that tell you more about
this. The information must be embedded in the HTML, the XML or the PDFs. The emphasis for DOAJ is not HOW the
license is embedded but that there IS a <b>machine-readable</b> version of it. Here are a couple of examples:
<ol>
<li><a href="http://www.globalhealthaction.net/index.php/gha/article/view/23456">Displayed in the HTML on an article
abstract page</a></li>
<li><a href="http://www.plosone.org/article/info%3Adoi%2F10.1371%2Fjournal.pone.0097648">

<h3><b><a name="casereport"></a>Do case reports count as original articles?</b></h3>
<p>When applying for a journal to be included in DOAJ, you should include case reports in your article count if they
include the retrospective analysis of more than 3 clinical cases. When more than three cases are involved, the
article constitutes "research." A journal that publishes only case reports</p>

<h3><b><a name="humanities"></a>Do you accept journals that carry out editorial review only (instead of peer review)?</b></h3> 
<p>DOAJ recognises that some journals may not publish in a field where peer review is the established form of quality
assurance. Instead a system of editorial review—carried out by the editors or the editors and members of the editorial
board only—is in place. This is particularly relevant to the Humanities. 'Editorial review' will only be accepted as 
an answer to <a href="/application/new#review_process-container">Question 35 of the Application Form</a> if the 
journal publishes in some such field. We do not accept journals that only have one editor with no editorial board.</p>

<h3><b><a name="deposit"></a>We have no deposit restrictions on articles published in our journal. Why does the
Application Form ask for information about deposit policies?</b></h3>
<p>Funders, libraries and authors can all access deposit policy directories to get an overview of publishing
channels that are compliant with, for instance, funder policies. This is one of our areas where we are encouraging
Best Practice. A good example of a deposit policy directory is

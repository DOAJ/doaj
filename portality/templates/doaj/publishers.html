<h3><a id="pubmem"></a>1) How to become a Publisher Member</h3>
<p>DOAJ is a membership organisation that relies entirely on voluntary donations from the community to develop and 
grow. We urge you to <a href="{{ url_for('doaj.support') }}">become a Publisher Member</a>.

<ul>
<li>It is a clear statement of intent about your commitment to quality, peer-reviewed open access.</li>
<li>Your contribution directly enables DOAJ to develop and improve so it consistently meets the demands of the open 
access community.</li>
<li>You may carry the DOAJ logo on your web site.</li>
</ul>

<p>Being a Publisher Member does not guarantee that your journals will be included in the DOAJ. All applications are 
treated equally from both members and non-members.</p>
<br><br>

<!-- SECTION ADVICE -->


<h3><a id="advice"></a>3) Publishing best practice and basic standards for inclusion</h3>
<p>Here are some publishing best practices. These are not ideas generated by DOAJ but are common publishing standards 
for online journals and digital posting. We have also consulted <a href="http://oaspa.org/membership/code-of-conduct/">
  OASPA's Code of Conduct</a> and we are co-authors to the <a href="{{ url_for('doaj.bestpractice') }}">Principles of 
  Transparency and Best Practice in Scholarly Publishing</a>. Where stated, some of the items below are counted as 
<i style="color: red">basic requirements for inclusion in DOAJ</i>.</p>

<p><b>Coverage:</b><br>
<ul>
<li>Subject: all scientific and scholarly subjects are covered in DOAJ. We use the
<a href="http://www.loc.gov/catdir/cpso/lcco/">Library of Congress Classification Outline</a>.</li>
<li>Types of resource: scientific and scholarly periodicals that publish research or review papers in full text.</li>
<li>Acceptable sources: academic, government, commercial, non-profit and private sources are all acceptable.</li>
<li>Level: the primary target group should be researchers.  If the journal is run by a student body, the journal must 
have an advisory board of which at least two members have a PhD or equivalent.</li>
<li>Content: at least a third of the content should consist of 
<a href="https://doaj.org/application/new#articles_last_year-container">peer reviewed original research and/or review papers</a>. All content 
should be available in <a href="https://doaj.org/application/new#first_fulltext_oa_year-container">full text on the site 
without embargo</a>. See our <a href="#casereports">policy for journals that publish case reports</a>.</li>
<li><a href="https://doaj.org/application/new#languages-container">All languages are accepted</a>.</li>
</ul>


<p><a id="access"></a><b>Access:</b><br>
<ul>
<li>The full text of ALL content must be <a href="https://doaj.org/application/new#first_fulltext_oa_year-container">available
for free and be Open Access without delay (i.e. no embargo period)</a>.
<i style="color: red">This is a basic requirement for entry into DOAJ.</i></li>
<li>A charge may exist for a print version of the journal.</li>
<li>User registration is not acceptable and journals requiring users to register to read full
text are not accepted into DOAJ.</li>
</ul>


<p><b>One URL per site. One dedicated page to the journal.</b><br>
<p>When a journal gets indexed it will have its own record in the Directory. To make our service comprehensible and 
user-friendly, <a href="https://doaj.org/application/new#url-container">the link to a journal</a> from the Directory must go 
straight to a homepage for the journal and not to a collection of journals or any other service. Whether the URL is a dedicated
domain or a sub-domain does not matter; but the journal must have an online space dedicated to it. For example: 
www.thisisajournal.com or www.publishersite.com/journals/thisisajournal or www.mycollege.org/thisisajournal are all acceptable.
www.largesearchengine.com that includes journal content is not accepted. <i style="color: red">This is a basic requirement for 
entry into DOAJ.</i></p>

<p><a id="infopages"></a>All the necessary journal business information pages (by 'business information pages', we 
mean the journal's <a href="https://doaj.org/application/new#aims_scope_url-container">aims and scope</a>, 
<a href="https://doaj.org/application/new#editorial_board_url-container">the editorial board</a>, the 
<a href="https://doaj.org/application/new#instructions_authors_url-container">instructions for authors</a>, the description
of <a href="https://doaj.org/application/new#review_process-container">the quality control system</a>, the 
<a href="https://doaj.org/application/new#oa_statement_url-container">Open Access statement</a>, the 
<a href="https://doaj.org/application/new#plagiarism_screening-container">plagiarism policy</a>, and the 
<a href="https://doaj.org/application/new#license_url-container">licensing terms</a>) must be hosted on this same site and not
be held centrally on another web site, or must be prominently linked to from the journal's homepage. <i style="color: red">
This is a basic requirement for entry into DOAJ.</i> This applies particularly to multi-journal publishers who may prefer to 
hold generic information on a corporate website rather than locally on each journal site. Our insistence on this approach makes
it easier for visitors to your sites to find specific journal information correctly. Do not assume that visitors to a 
journal will automatically understand that the journal belongs to a larger group of journals or to a specific publisher, or 
that important information is held elsewhere. Neither should it be taken for granted that users will search for the necessary 
information that they need to carry out a full assessment of your journal. It is your responsibility to 
ensure that the information pages are findable, easily accessible, up to date and relevant.</p>

<p>When submitting URLs in your application, note that we will only accept one URL per answer. Applications with more than one URL in a URL field will be rejected.</p>

<p>DOAJ also requests that a journal has its own dedicated website. No other service or product should be present 
under that URL. All the journal content that the publisher is including in the application must be in one place and 
not spread over various locations. This includes archive material. <i style="color: red">This is a basic requirement 
for entry into DOAJ.</i></p>


<p><b>One unique URL per article. One HTML entry or PDF per article.</b><br>
<p>Your content should be available article by article, one URL for each article, and not one URL per issue. This 
enables direct linking to the articles from DOAJ and 3rd party databases that link to DOAJ, promoting findability and 
increasing usage of your content. When article metadata is uploaded to DOAJ, every article must have a unique URL 
otherwise the upload will not work.<i style="color: red">This is a basic requirement for entry into DOAJ.</i></p>

<p><a id="issns"></a><b>ISSN number(s)</b><br>
<p>A journal must have <a href="https://doaj.org/application/new#pissn-container">at least one ISSN</a> (International 
Standard Serial Number) registered at issn.org. <i style="color: red">This is a 
basic requirement for entry into DOAJ.</i> DOAJ will use the data registered at issn.org to verify the title, country and 
alternative titles that you enter in your application. They must match. If we find a discrepancy, we will change the 
application to match what is registered at issn.org. Applications will be automatically rejected where the ISSN provided: is not 
recognised; is incorrectly formatted; has not yet been confirmed or is listed as provisional; is fake; does not match the title given on
 the website. Applications will also be rejected if the title on the website does not match what is held at issn.org.</p>

<p>You can double check what information issn.org holds about your ISSN(s) here: https://portal.issn.org/.  If you wish to update the 
  information held at issn.org about your journal, you should 
  <a href="http://www.issn.org/the-centre-and-the-network/members-countries/the-issn-network-today/">contact your national ISSN 
    centre</a>.</p>
<p>In general, if the journal exists in print and online, it will have both an ISSN for the print version and an ISSN 
for the electronic version.</p>

<p><a id="archiving"></a><b>Archiving and Preservation</b><br>
<p>We strongly recommend that your content is preserved in 
<a href="https://doaj.org/application/new#digital_archiving_policy-container">a dedicated, digital archiving and preservation
service</a>, sometimes referred to as Long Term Preservation and Archiving (LTPA).
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_digital_preservation_initiatives">You can find a list some of these 
services here.</a> We prefer that journals belong to one of these services, although it is not a requirement for 
entry into DOAJ. We check all preservation statuses in <a href="https://keepers.issn.org/">the 
Keepers' Registry</a> and at PubMed Central. If your journal is hosted on the Open Journal Systems (OJS) software and you have selected to be part of the PKP Private LOCKSS network, we must first see that content has actually been deposited by confirming its preservation status with the Keepers Registry.</p>

<p><a id="content"></a><b>Organisation of content</b><br>
Please pay attention to the fact that having a clear structure when organizing your published material makes it easier 
for users to navigate between articles, for your content to be indexed in search engines and to be found online.</p>

<p>All articles must have a Publication Date. Also, DOAJ encourages the use of 
<a href="https://doaj.org/application/new#article_identifiers-container">unique article identifiers</a>, such as 
<a href="http://www.crossref.org/02publishers/index.html">the DOI</a>.</p>

<p>Preferably articles will be gathered in volumes and issues, with a start and end page number. Some publishers 
have moved away from this traditional volume/issue/page structure for their content. A publication year is still required.</p>

<p>Articles should be arranged in to Tables of Contents and there should be Search/Browse features to allow users to search and
browse for articles.</p>

<p><a id="homepage"></a><b>Homepage quality, commercials and ads</b><br>
A journal's homepage should be clear, concise and easy to navigate. It must contain visible links to 
<a href="#infopages">the journal information pages</a>. It must 'demonstrate that care has been taken to ensure high 
ethical and professional standards.' (From the <a href="{{ url_for('doaj.bestpractice') }}">Principles of Transparency
and Best Practice in Scholarly Publishing</a>.) It must contain clear navigation with links to a Current Issue, the 
Archive or Past Issues, Search, Browse, the About page, the Editorial Board and Contact Us. <i style="color: red">This is a basic 
requirement for entry into DOAJ.</i></p>

<p>If the journal web site carries advertising, ensure that the ads are not in any way offensive, irrelevant and that 
they don't include information that could decrease the credibility of the journal. Blinking and/or moving objects 
will distract a reader and will make your web site difficult to use and inaccessible to users who access the Internet 
using non-traditional methods . These types of ads are strongly discouraged.</p>

<p><a id="IF"></a><b>Impact Factors</b><br>
DOAJ does not believe in the value of impact factors, does not condone their use on journal web sites, does not 
recognise partial impact factors, and advocates any official, alternative measure of use, such as article level 
metrics.</p>

<p>There is only one official, universally recognised impact factor that is generated by Clarivate; it is a 
proprietary measure run by a profit-making organisation. This runs against the ethics and principles of open access 
and DOAJ is impact-factor agnostic. DOAJ does not collect metadata on impact factors. <!-- Displaying impact factors 
on a home page is strongly discouraged and DOAJ perceives this as an attempt to lure authors in a dishonest way. --></p>

<p><a id="editor"></a><b>Editor(s) and editorial boards</b><br>
A journal must have <a href="https://doaj.org/application/new#editorial_board_url-container">an editor and an editorial board</a>
. (Only for <a href="#humanities">Arts and Humanities journals</a> will 
we accept a form of editorial review using only two editors and no editorial board.) If the journal is run by a student body, the 
  journal must have an advisory board of which at least two members have a PhD or equivalent.</p>

<p>Displaying 
clear and up-to-date information about the journal's editors and editorial board increases the trustworthiness and 
credibility of the journal. A site user must be able to find and contact the editor or members of the editorial or advisory board if 
  they need to. A link to the Board must be displayed prominently on the journal's home page. The name and affiliation of the 
  editorial board members must be publicly available on the Editorial Board page. The page must be up-to-date. <i style="color: red">These 
are basic requirements for entry into DOAJ</i>.</p>

<p><a id="QC"></a><b>Quality control and author guidelines</b><br>
It is very important to show that open access journals have the same, rigorous quality control systems in place as 
traditional printed or subscription-based journals. All articles must go through 
<a href="https://doaj.org/application/new#review_process-container">a quality control system (editorial 
or peer review)</a> before publication and the exact type of review must be stated clearly on the web site. 
<i style="color: red">This is a basic requirement for entry into DOAJ</i>.</p>

<p>Having detailed and comprehensive <a href="https://doaj.org/application/new#instructions_authors_url-container">
  guidelines for authors (Instructions for Authors)</a> is a good way of helping 
potential contributors. A link to these guidelines must be clearly presented on the journal's homepage. 
<i style="color: red">This is a basic requirement for entry into DOAJ</i>.</p>

<p>We recommend that author guidelines include the following information:
<ul>
<li>A detailed style guide;</li>
<li>A description of the quality control processes;</li>
<li>Information about copyright (please note the importance of informing authors about whether the journal will be 
the copyright holder after publication of an article or if the copyright remains with the author(s). We strongly 
believe that authors should be informed about your copyright/licensing conditions before they submit their work);</li>
<li>the plagiarism policy;</li>
<li>description of how to submit an article;</li>
<li>a contact email address.</li>
</ul>


<p><a id="charges"></a><b>Charges, Article processing charges</b><br>
Every journal must display clearly on its web site information about any charges for an author to 
process or publish a paper. This includes <a href="https://doaj.org/application/new#processing_charges-container">article
processing charges (APCs)</a>, <a href="https://doaj.org/application/new#submission_charges-container">submission charges</a>,
page charges, colour charges or any instance where money is required to complete the publication process. If a journal does not levy any 
charges then this too must be clearly stated. <i style="color: red">These are basic requirements for entry into DOAJ</i>.</p>

<p><a id="OAstatement"></a><b>Open Access statement</b><br>
The journal's <a href="https://doaj.org/application/new#oa_statement_url-container">Open Access policy must be clearly stated</a>
on the journal's web site (not the publisher's own site). The full text
of the articles of the journal should be freely available without embargo.<i style="color: red">These are basic requirements 
for entry into DOAJ</i>.</p>

<p>Here is an example of an Open Access statement, fitting our criteria, that could be published on your website:</p>
<blockquote>This is an open access journal which means that all content is freely available without charge to the 
user or his/her institution. Users are allowed to read, download, copy, distribute, print, search, or link to the 
full texts of the articles, or use them for any other lawful purpose, without asking prior permission from the 
publisher or the author. This is in accordance with the BOAI definition of open access.</blockquote>

<p>DOAJ will accept a short open access statement—even as short as ‘This journal is open access.’—but ONLY in combination 
with a Creative Commons licensing statement, or equivalent licensing statement, on the same page and, preferably, in the same 
paragraph. If the licensing statement is not on the same page as the open access statement then the extended open access 
statement complying with BOAI definition will be required.</p>
<br><br>

<!-- SECTION LICENSING -->

<h3><a id="licensing"></a><b>4) Copyright, Licensing, Publishing Rights</b></h3>

<p><i>Licensing your material with a CC license</i>: An optimum way of showing exactly <i>how</i> a journal is Open Access is by
<a href="https://creativecommons.org/choose/">licensing the content with a Creative Commons (CC) license</a>. DOAJ considers the
application of a <a href="https://doaj.org/application/new#license-container">CC license, or its equivalent</a>, as best 
practice. Such licensing is very beneficial for authors since it shows, for example, if there are any limits in creating
derivative works. Read more about applying licenses and copyright on our <a href="https://doaj.org/rights">Copyright and 
Licensing Help page</a>.</p>

<p>In all instances the journal web site must state clearly and precisely the terms of use and reuse that readers and authors 
have when they submit an article or use the published content, particularly if you are not using a Creative Commons license. This 
is a way of showing that you are sharing your published material to support a greater global exchange of knowledge. It is also a 
way of protecting your material from illegal use (for example if you are stating that you prohibit reproduction or commercial use 
of your articles).<i style="color: red">These are basic requirements for entry into DOAJ</i></p>

<p>For example, your site might state that: 'users can use, reuse and build upon the material published in 
the journal but only for non-commercial purposes'. <i>Use, reuse and build upon</i> refer specifically to the 
common definitions of open access, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_access#Policies_and_mandates">given for example 
in Wikipedia</a>. 'Use' is downloading or reading and not much more; 're-use' is making more use of the content, for example 
distributing, making copies, using in presentations; 'building upon' is a special form of re-use in which material is used to 
produce a new research work and, possibly, a new publication. Publishers may restrict the re-use of open access content (to 
Non-Commercial or to Share Alike as described in the corresponding Creative Commons license attributes: NC and SA) and may even 
prohibit building upon content by not allowing Derivatives (the altering, transformation, or building upon content, as described 
in the corresponding Creative Commons license attributes: ND) to be made.</p>

<p><b><i>Publishers who restrict the re-use of content in line with any of the Creative Commons licenses are all still eligible
for indexing in DOAJ</i></b>. However, DOAJ has a strong preference for the use of Creative Commons licenses, especially the 
least restrictive: the Creative Commons CC-BY license (Attribution). Under the terms of a CC BY license "you must give 
appropriate credit, provide a link to the license, and indicate if changes were made". "You may do so in any reasonable manner,
but not in any way that suggests the licensor endorses you or your use" (from 
<a href="https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/">http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/)</a>.</p>

<p>Read our dedicated <a href="https://doaj.org/rights">Copyright and Licensing Help page</a> for more information.</p>

<p>For more information on embedded licensing information as referred to in 
<a href="https://doaj.org/application/new#license_embedded-container">Question 45 of the application form</a>, please refer 
to the <a href="https://doaj.org/rights">Copyright and Licensing Help</a> page, 
<a href="https://doaj.org/publishers#embedded">this FAQ</a> and 
<a href="https://doajournals.wordpress.com/2015/05/19/copyright-and-licensing-incompatibility-part-1/#embedded">our blog 
post</a> on this matter.</p>

<p>If you are NOT using a Creative Commons license, you must fill in your application form 
<a href="https://doaj.org/application/new#license_checkbox-container">specifying what other usage terms 
apply</a>. This is Question 48 in the form, which is revealed if you have selected 'Other' in Question 47. 'Other' might be a 
contract, publishing agreement, publisher-specific license and these terms must be equivalent to the terms of the 
Creative Commons licenses that are listed in order to be accepted into DOAJ. When writing their own license, we strongly advise
publishers to get legal advice before adopting a standard text or constructing their own. You must make sure that you use the 
correct legal language. (The information provided here does not constitute legal advice.)</p>

<p>Please note that "Fair Use" is different to Open Access and is interpreted differently in the United States, Europe and 
in various other countries in the world. Fair use often means allowing limited use for educational purposes without having to 
ask for permission. Fair use applies irrespective of Open Access and open access licensing conditions. A journal offering only 
Fair use will always be rejected.</p>

<p>Please take care to identify any possible contradictions between your Open Access policy and your copyright 
policy, or any incompatibilities between your copyright policy and Creative Commons licensing. 
<a href="https://doajournals.wordpress.com/category/copyright-and-licensing/">Read more about this on our blog.</a></p>

<p>If licensing old material, please make sure that your journal holds the copyright for the published 
material. If you do not, you have to ask the original copyright holder for permission before licensing the articles.
(More information can be found in the <a href="https://wiki.creativecommons.org/Before_Licensing">Creative Commons
wiki</a>.)</p>


<p><a id="plagiarism"></a><b>Plagiarism</b><br>
It is recommended that publishers make use of one of the several plagiarism detection services that are available.
Plagiarism is a big problem and plagiarised articles on a web site are often an indicator of a poor quality 
journal, or a journal that uses no quality control system. You should 
<a href="https://doaj.org/application/new#plagiarism_screening-container">publish a plagiarism statement on your 
site</a>, as well as the name of the piece of software that you use to detect plagiarism.</p>
<!-- <p>If a journal is a member of the <a href="http://publicationethics.org/">Committee on Publication Ethics (COPE)</a>, this
should be stated clearly on the web site.</p> -->
<br><br>


<!-- SECTION APPLYING -->

<h3><a id="applying"></a>5) Applying for your journal to be in DOAJ</h3>
<p>For a journal to be included in DOAJ, it must go through the application process. <a href="/application/new">The application
form</a> is very detailed and it will take time to complete. You are advised to collect all the necessary information up front before
  you start filling in the form. You cannot save your progress in the form so you must submit the application in one session.</p>

<p>IMPORTANT NOTE<br>
If the application  you are submitting contains information that is inaccurate or wrong, or if answers have been missed or skipped, then it will be automatically rejected. For example, an application is submitted with multiple URLs in a URL field or the same URL is provided throughout the application form. These applications will be automatically rejected without review.</p>

<p><a id="spreadsheet"></a><b>Before you start</b><br>
<ol>
<li>Make sure that you have <a href="#advice">read the section above</a> and that your web site fulfills those 
items marked in italics as basic requirements for entry into DOAJ.</li>
<li>Read <a href="#advice">our disclaimer</a> and make sure you fully understand its implications.</li>
<li>Make sure that you have read and have fully understood <a href="{{ url_for('doaj.bestpractice') }}">
  Principles of Transparency and Best Practice in Scholarly Publishing</a>. Does your journal comply?</li>
<li>Make sure you have downloaded and read through the <a href="http://bit.ly/1MLszb4">'application form as 
a spreadsheet'</a> document as this will help you complete the application. Use this spreadsheet as a place to collect the information.</li>
</ol>

<p><b>Filling in the application form</b><br>
<p>You must submit an application online. Do not email a spreadsheet.</p>
<p>The information that you provide in <a href="/application/new">the application</a> must match what is displayed on your 
web site. Doublecheck that the information you are submitting matches.</p>

<p><a id="impnote"></a>IMPORTANT NOTE<br>
If the application form contains information that is inaccurate or clearly wrong, or if answers have been missed or skipped, then it will 
be automatically rejected. To give an example of one of the most commonly encountered errors: sometimes applications are submitted where 
every question that asks for a URL contains the same answer over and over, just pointing to the same page, the homepage. Our editorial 
teams will not spend time reviewing these applications and they will be automatically rejected.</p>

<p><a href="https://doaj.org/application/new#contact_name-container">The details you provide for the Journal Contact</a> must be a real
person with their full name. Answers such as Editor, Admin, Webmaster, Editorial etc will be automatically rejected.</p>

<p><a id="address"></a><a href="https://doaj.org/application/new#country-container">The country that you use in your application</a> must be the 
country of the publisher, where the publisher carries out the majority of the editorial processes, business functions and
day-to-day activities. The country of an address registered via a registering agent (typically: the United States) is not 
allowed.</p>

<p><a href="http://andreamarchitelli.it/actual/tag/doaj/">Alcune risorse sono disponibili anche in italiano | 
Some further resources are available in Italian</a>. (These posts have been created by one of our Associate Editors, Andrea 
Marchitelli.)</p>

<p><b>Once you submit your application</b><br>
<p>Upon submission you will be shown a confirmation screen and you will be sent a confirmation email. Save this 
email as it will help us find your application later, should you have any questions about it. If you do not get a cofirmation
email, please contact us.</p>

<p>Each journal application may be assessed by up to four different members of the DOAJ Team:</p>
<ol>
<li><b>Triage</b>. Duplicate applications will be automatically rejected. 
Applications for journals where malware or spyware is detected will be automatically rejected. 
Applications that have no ISSN(s) or fake ISSN(s), or that contain ISSN(s) not registered at www.issn.org will be automatically
rejected. Titles that differ from what is registered at issn.org will be changed to match issn.org. It is YOUR responsibility
to make sure that issn.org hold the most current and up-to-date version of your information. We will not notify you if your 
application has been rejected for any of these. </li>
  
<li><b>Managing Editor</b>: will review the application and assign it to an Editor Group. Post review, the Managing
Editor will make the final decision on whether to accept or reject your application. A Managing Editor may decide 
to reject an application without further review, especially if the application that you have submitted is incomplete.
You will be notified.</li>
<li><b>Editor</b>: will assign the application to an Associate Editor. Post review, the Editor will double check the
Associate Editor's recommendations.</li>
<li><b>Associate Editor</b>: will carry out the review of your application and will email you to ask questions, if
necessary. The Associate Editor will make a 'reject' or 'accept' recommendation.</li>
</ol>
<p>DO NOT submit your application more than once. Duplicate applications are automatically rejected without 
notification.</p>

<p><b>Waiting for a decision</b><br>
<p>You will receive an automated email when your application is assigned to a member of the editorial team. You will receive a
second automated email when that person starts working on it. Every application is reviewed manually and it takes time to ensure that
  we do this carefully and thoroughly. We carry out this process as quickly as possible but also to a very high standard. Currently, 
  due to the number of applications we are receiving every week, it is taking up to 6 months to make a decision on 
an application or update request. We apologise in advance for the extended wait but please be assured that we are working as hard
as we can with the resources that we have. We ask you to refrain for requesting status updates for applications that are under
6 months' old.</p>

<p><a id="rejection"></a><b>Reasons for rejection</b><br>
<p>One of the most common reasons for rejection is that we receive no response to our emails. We will automatically reject 
the application after 1 month. Please be sure to check your Spam folder frequently and be aware that the Associate Editor 
who is reviewing your application is a volunteer and will not be emailing you from a doaj.org email address.</p>

<p>Common reasons for rejection are:</p>
<ul>
<li>there is no response from the applicant</li>
<li>the contact details provided do not include a name</li>
<li>nothing has been published in the last calendar year</li>
<li>incomplete or incorrect ISSN information</li>
<li>incomplete application</li>
<li>every URL in the application form is identical</li>
<li>duplicate application</li>
<li>the journal is already in DOAJ</li>
<li>the journal does not adhere to the Principles of Transparency and Best Practice in Scholarly Publishing</li>
<li>the journal does not fulfil the basic requirements listed on this page</li>
<li>the journal is not open access</li>
<li>the journal does not publish original research</li>
</ul>
<br><br>


<!-- SECTION ACCEPTED -->

<h3><a id="accepted"></a>6) If your application is accepted</h3>
<p>Upon acceptance into DOAJ, the journal is classified by subject and assigned an LCC code by the DOAJ team. An 
automatic confirmation email is sent to the <a href="https://doaj.org/application/new#contact_email-container">Journal Contact</a>
(this may be different to the Applicant). A second email is sent that contains details on how to log in to your Publisher 
account. You will need these details to upload article metadata. The journal is then visible in DOAJ immediately. If you do 
not get your email, check your Spam folder before contacting us. Your journal may have been added to an existing account in 
which case no email is sent.</p>
<br><br>

<!-- SECTION REJECTED -->

<h3><a id="rejected"></a>7) If your application is rejected</h3>
<p>If your application is rejected, you will receive an email from us detailing the reason(s) for the rejection. A rejected journal may apply again for inclusion, usually after 6 months, unless otherwise stated, and once it has demonstrated clearly that it meets all of the requirements stated on this page. Applications submitted before the end of the stated period will be automatically rejected.</p>

<p>We ask applicants to wait 6 months (unless a longer time period has been communicated - <a href="#disclaimer">see below</a>) before submitting another application for two reasons. The first is because we want to discourage repeat applications, made in hsate, and we get many, many of those. Repeat and duplicate applications clog up the system and take our dedicated volunteers and team away from those applications which need some time spent on them. (In 10 months alone, DOAJ received 221 duplicate applications!)
    
<p>The second reason is that many of the recommendations that we make in our rejection emails, recommendations made to help journals meet our criteria, take time to implement. Adding words to a website isn’t enough. Changes need to be implemented properly, communicated to stakeholders, tested, and managed. Some changes will require other parties to implement changes too. This all takes time. After the 6 months has passed, we welcome a new application but we ask that the journal website demonstrates very clearly that our recommendations have been put into practice and our editorial team will be very careful to check that all our recommendations have been implemented. </p>
<br><br>

<!-- SECTION DISCLAIMER -->

<h3><a id="disclaimer"></a>8) Publishing Disclaimer</h3>
<p>The applicant is responsible for providing accurate information when submitting an application for consideration.
If the information provided is not sufficient or is incomplete, the application will not be considered. In cases 
where the information provided is found to be untrue, either during reviewing or even after admission, we reserve the
right to reject or remove the journal with immediate effect and to not accept new applications for a period of 1 
year. In cases where a single publisher has submitted more than 5 applications with false information, we reserve 
the right to remove all of the publisher's journals listed in DOAJ and to not accept any more applications for a 
maximum period of 3 years, depending on the number of journals for which false information was provided and the 
eventual number of repeated incidents.</p>

<p>DOAJ's general disclaimer is available on our About page.</p>

<br><br>

<!-- SECTION UPLOADING XML -->

<h3><a id="upload"></a>9) How to get your journal content / article metadata indexed in DOAJ. Uploading content.</h3>

<p>It is the publisher's responsibility to upload article metadata to DOAJ. At this time, DOAJ doesn't go out and harvest metadata.</p>

<p>PLEASE NOTE that DOAJ doesn't want author email addresses. We kindly ask that you don't send any email addresses to us in metadata uploadeds. Email addresses should be stripped out before the metadata is uploaded. Recent guidelines on <a href="/privacy">the use of personal data</a> restrict what you can send us.</p>

<p>TO UPLOAD CONTENT TO US log in to <a href="{{ url_for('publisher.index') }}">your Publisher Area</a> and choose '<a href="https://doaj.org/publisher/uploadfile">Upload Article XML</a>' (automated) or '<a href="https://doaj.org/publisher/metadata">Enter Article Metadata</a>' (manual).</p>

<p>You can only upload metadata for journals that belong to your account. Uploads will only work if the ISSN(s) you provide matches the ISSN(s) we have on file for <a href="https://doaj.org/publisher/">your journals</a>. Discrepancies will cause the upload to fail. If you need to update an ISSN on a journal record, submit an update request to us.</p>

<p>Every article you upload to DOAJ must have a unique URL. If you use the same URL for all articles, the upload will
fail.</p>

<p>It is strongly recommended that a DOI is provided (where available) for each article.</p>

<p>We can only display one language for titles and abstracts. If your XML contains two or more languages, the first occurring language in the XML will be displayed. On 3rd February 2020, we updated the code lists that we use for country, currency and language. This means that some codes which were previously recognised will no longer work. These code lists are referenced in our XSD file which all XML uploads are compared against. If your upload contains one of the old codes, the upload will fail. You will see the error <a href="/publishers#Unable%20to%20validate%20document%20with%20identified%20schema">'Unable to validate document with identified schema'</a>. The full details of all the code changes can be found in <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1qpM7E35ctd6wtm-dKAbs3dW359Zo2q3qN3u98-T7P5I/edit?usp=sharing">this list</a>. If your uploads suddenly fail on or after Monday 3rd February 2020 then it is worth consulting this list.</a></p>

<p><a id="uploading_XML"></a>Uploading metadata to us:</p>
<ul>
<li><b>via the 'Upload Article XML' tab</b>. You can upload the file manually by selecting it from a location on your computer OR you can enter the URL where we should go to find the file. The location can be http or ftp.<br>
We accept two formats of XML: DOAJ or Crossref.<br>
For DOAJ XML, we suggest you <a href="http://www.freeformatter.com/xml-formatter.html">format the file</a> and 
<a href="http://www.freeformatter.com/xml-validator-xsd.html">validate it</a> before you upload it to us. 
(<a href="/static/doaj/doajArticles.xsd">The latest version of the DOAJ xsd file is here</a>.) Español:(<a href="https://doaj.org/static/doaj/doajArticles.xsd">El archivo xsd de DOAJ está aquí</a>.) Estos dos pasos identifican la mayoría de problemas. <br>

You will see a message 'File uploaded and waiting to be processed. Check back here for updates.' Processing takes place every 30 minutes.
All XML files are checked for errors and if a problem is found, an error message is displayed, 'processing failed', in the
'History of uploads' section. If the upload is successful, you will see 'Successfully processed'. Articles are processed every 30 minutes. As soon as the XML has processed successfully, the articles are published to the site. The Table of Contents for a journal updates overnight.</li>

<li><b>by manually entering the metadata</b>, using the 'Enter Article Metadata' tab. This method is 
ideal for uploading the occasional article or for correcting an existing article.<br>
Metadata uploaded this way is checked for errors and published to the site immediately. Do not enter HTML formatting, tables, images, style sheet (CSS) coding from Microsoft Word, or any other form of code. This will cause an error and will distort hhow your articles are displayed and found.<br>
To correct existing articles, the full text URL must remain the same otherwise the new version will not overwrite the 
old version.</li>

<li><b>Use <a href="{{ url_for('api_v2.docs')  }}">the DOAJ API</a></b>. This is the least labour intensive. You will need to request that we enable your API key on your account page. <a href="{{ url_for('doaj.contact') }}">Contact us</a> to do that. You should also <a href="https://doaj.org/api/v1/docs#intro_help">sign up to our API groups</a> for API support.</li>

<!-- SECTION FAILED UPLOADS -->
<!-- This section is referred to from the Publisher Article XML Upload page, so all references MUST be kept consistent -->

<h3><a id="failed"></a>10) Failed XML uploads</h3>

<p>This section describes the possible error messages that you may see when you upload an article XML file
to DOAJ.  Depending on the message in the "Notes" column of your <a href="{{ url_for('publisher.upload_file') }}">uploads</a> table,
some corrective actions may be available to you.</p>

<p>In cases where there is no action to be taken, or the suggested actions have not successfully resolved the issues,
please <a href="{{ url_for('doaj.contact') }}">contact us</a> with the following details:</p>

<ul>
    <li>The time of the file upload</li>
    <li>The exact error message as it appears in the "Notes" column</li>
    <li>Your publisher account username</li>
    <li>A copy of the file you had problems with</li>
</ul>


<h4><a id="some_articles_failed"></a>X articles imported (Y new, Z updated); N articles failed</h4>

<p><strong>Reason</strong>: From within the provided file, there were some successful article imports (X), but one or more failed article imports (N)</p>

<p><strong>Resolution</strong>: Individual articles can fail for a number of reasons.  See the section <a href="#Reasons for individual article import failures">Reasons for individual article import failures</a> below</p>

<h4><a id="All articles in file failed to import"></a>All articles in file failed to import</h4>

<p><strong>Reason</strong>: From within the uploaded file, there were no successful article imports and one or more failed article imports</p>

<p><strong>Resolution</strong>: Individual articles can fail for a number of reasons.  See the section <a href="#Reasons for individual article import failures">Reasons for individual article import failures</a> below</p>

<h4><a id="Error occurred ingesting the records in the document"></a>Error occurred ingesting the records in the document</h4>

<p><strong>Reason</strong>: An unexpected software exception occurred - you may have found a bug!</p>

<p><strong>Resolution</strong>: Please <a href="{{ url_for('doaj.contact') }}">contact us</a> immediately with the relevant details.</p>


<h4><a id="Unanticipated error when importing articles"></a>Unanticipated error when importing articles</h4>

<p><strong>Reason</strong>: Something unexpected happened when we tried to import your articles - you may have found a bug!</p>

<p><strong>Resolution</strong>: Please <a href="{{ url_for('doaj.contact') }}">contact us</a> immediately with the details:</p>

<ol>
    <li>Your user account</li>
    <li>The contact details for the person reporting the bug (or at least a proxy for them, so that we can request more details). That might be you or someone working on your behalf.</li>
    <li>Was the problem repeatable? Did you try several times with the same result?</li>
    <li>What environment are you in? Specifically browser, or if not in the browser then any useful information about your API client such as the user agent.</li>
    <li>At what time the incident occurred. Both date and time ideally. If it happened several times, then all dates/times that were recorded, or a range.</li>
    <li>What were you trying to do? As much detail and context as possible. Send a screenshot! An image helps.</li>
    <lki>What happened, what error message was received? Provide the exact error message, don't paraphrase. A screenshot could be provided here.</li>
    <li>Which area of the system did this happen in. Generally, in the UI/API/OAI, and ideally specifically: which URL were you on when it happened, or which URL were you trying to access?</li>
    <li>Send copies of any data you sent to the system. For example, article XML files uploaded, or payloads send to the API, if available.</li>
    <li>What had you expected to happen?</li>
</ol>

<p>We may also ask you to supply the file that you tried to upload, so please keep a copy of it until the issue is resolved.</p>

<h4><a id="The file at the URL was too large"></a>The file at the URL was too large</h4>

<p><strong>Reason</strong>: A URL (either HTTP or FTP) you provided to the form field "Provide a URL where we can download the XML" led to a file which was larger than 250Mb</p>

<p><strong>Resolution</strong>: Please provide a smaller file in either case. You can split the articles across two or more schema valid documents, and make them available to us separately.</p>


<h4><a id="The URL could not be accessed"></a>The URL could not be accessed</h4>

<p><strong>Reason 1</strong>: The HTTP URL you provided could not be resolved to a resource on the web (e.g. your web server responded with a 404 Not Found)</p>

<p><strong>Resolution 1</strong>: Check the following regarding the URL your provided to the form field "Provide a URL where we can download the XML":</p>

<ul>
    <li>That the URL is the correct URL</li>
    <li>That there are no access restrictions on the URL.  For example, authentication is required, or the URL is IP restricted to within your organisation.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Reason 2</strong>: The download from an HTTP URL you provided failed part way through for an unspecified reason</p>

<p><strong>Resolution 2</strong>: Re-try the upload, as this may be an intermittent network issue.</p>

<p>If you are still unable to get the upload to work after a several attempts, please <a href="{{ url_for('doaj.contact') }}">contact us</a> with the relevant details.</p>


<h4><a id="Unable to parse file"></a>Unable to parse file</h4>

<p><strong>Reason</strong>: The XML file you provided (either downloaded from a URL or uploaded via the web form) could not be read as an XML file</p>

<p><strong>Resolution</strong>: Check that the file really is valid XML.</p>

<p>In some cases this will be easy - you may have uploaded/provided the wrong file, so double-check that it is the correct one.  You'd get this error, for example, if you
have uploaded a Word document or a PDF by mistake.</p>

<p>In other cases files can look very much like XML, but still be invalid.  They should be run through an XML validator to ensure they have the correct structure and that there are no illegal characters.</p>

<p>Sometimes, special characters - especially
those in scientific articles - are submitted in the wrong format. XML does not support many special characters as-is but those
that it does can be
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_XML_and_HTML_character_entity_references#Predefined_entities_in_XML">found
on Wikipedia</a>.</p>

<p>You can use one of these validators to check your XML:</p>

<ul>
    <li><a href="http://www.utilities-online.info/xsdvalidation">W3C Validator</a> - paste the contents of the XML into the left-hand box on this page</li>
    <li><a href="http://www.w3schools.com/xml/xml_validator.asp">W3Schools</a> - paste the contents of the XML into one of the boxes on this page</li>
    <li><a href="http://www.xmlvalidation.com/">xmlvalidation.com</a> - paste the contents of the XML into one of the boxes on this page, or upload the file</li>
</ul>


<h4><a id="Unable to parse XML file"></a>Unable to parse XML file</h4>

<p>See <a href="#Unable to parse file">"Unable to parse file"</a></p>

<h4><a id="Unable to validate document with identified schema"></a>Unable to validate document with identified schema</h4>

<p><strong>Reason</strong>: No XML schema could be found which would read the provided XML document (in particular, the DOAJ standard schema)</p>

<p><strong>Resolution</strong>: Check that the file conforms to the DOAJ schema, using a validator.</p>

<p>Often the problem arises because the XML is missing a required tag. If you try to upload XML to DOAJ that is missing a
specific tag, such as &lt;publicationDate&gt; then the schema validation will fail. You can see exactly
<a href="{{ url_for('doaj.features', _anchor='xml_upload') }}">which tags are required here</a>.</p>

<p>If you are trying to upload a file that was automatically generated by the
OJS DOAJ plugin, then you should first contact OJS for help.</p>

<p>The DOAJ schema is on our site, here: <a href="http://doaj.org/static/doaj/doajArticles.xsd">http://doaj.org/static/doaj/doajArticles.xsd</a></p>

<p>To validate the provided XML against the schema, you can use one of these services:</p>

<ul>
    <li><a href="http://www.utilities-online.info/xsdvalidation">W3C Validator</a> - paste the contents of the XML into the left-hand box on this page, and the contents of the schema (XSD) into the right-hand box.</li>
    <li><a href="http://www.freeformatter.com/xml-validator-xsd.html">freeformatter.com</a> - paste the contents of the XML into the top box, and the contents of the schema (XSD) into the bottom box.  Or, instead, provide a URL to either of them (you can use the URL <a href="http://doaj.org/static/doaj/doajArticles.xsd">http://doaj.org/static/doaj/doajArticles.xsd</a> for the DOAJ schema)</li>
</ul>

<p>If both of these services regard the provided XML as schema valid, please <a href="{{ url_for('doaj.contact') }}">contact us</a> with the relevant details.</p>

<h4><a id="Reasons for individual article import failures"></a>Reasons for individual article import failures</h4>

<p><strong>Reason</strong>: Article belongs to a journal that does not belong to your user account</p>

<p>You can only upload XML for the journals that are IN DOAJ and that appear in
the list under 'Your Journals' in the publisher area. If you have more than one account and you would like to merge
them, please contact us.</p>

<p>The Article's stated ISSNs must match to a journal that is owned by the user account from which you are providing the XML file.
If the ISSNs do not match any journals or match a journal that is owned by a different account, the import of that
article will fail.</p>

<p>Note that it is also possible that if an article has more than one ISSN (i.e. an E-ISSN and a P-ISSN), that those ISSNs 
could match more than one Journal (one ISSN matching one journal, the other ISSN matching another).  If both matched journals are owned by your account,
this will not stop the article from being imported, but if one of the matched journals is owned by a different account
this will cause the import of the article to fail.</p>

<p>A journal may have two ISSNs: an ISSN for the print version and an ISSN for the electronic version.
Sometimes the ISSNs of the journal have changed. If you need to have the ISSNs of your DOAJ record updated, 
please <a href="{{ url_for('doaj.contact') }}">contact us</a> and we will check that the ISSNs are registered at www.issn.org and will then
update the record accordingly.</p>

<p><strong>Resolution</strong>: Check that all the Article ISSNs in the file are correct</p>

<p>If you believe all the ISSNs for the articles are correct, please <a href="{{ url_for('doaj.contact') }}">contact us</a> with the relevant details.</p>

<h4><a id="One or more articles in this batch have duplicate identifiers"></a>One or more articles in this batch have duplicate identifiers</h4>

<p><strong>Reason</strong>: At least two of the articles in the uploaded file contain the same DOI and/or the same fulltext url</p>

<p><strong>Resolution</strong>: Ensure that there are no duplicated articles in the file.  Ensure that you are using the correct DOIs and URLs for all the articles.</p>

<h4><a id="One or more articles in this batch matched multiple articles as duplicates; entire batch ingest halted"></a>One or more articles in this batch matched multiple articles as duplicates; entire batch ingest halted</h4>

<p><strong>Reason</strong>: At least one of your articles matched two or more other articles already in DOAJ, and as a result we don't know which one to update.</p>

<p><strong>Resolution</strong>: Ensure that all your articles have the correct DOI and Fulltext links.  If you still don't have any luck, please <a href="{{ url_for('doaj.contact') }}">contact us</a> with the details; we may need to clean up your existing articles manually.</p>

<!-- =============================================================== -->


<!-- SECTION TROUBLESHOOTING XML -->

<h3><a id="trouble"></a>11) Troubleshooting XML uploads</h3>
<p>DOAJ is not staffed to help with XML queries. We have put together this list of resources and possible solutions 
that we have collected over the years. It is your responsibility to provide us with correctly formatted XML. HTML 
coding is NOT accepted: we only display plain text.</p>
<ul>
<li>If only the last article that you uploaded is appearing on the site (both in search and on the ToC), then it is 
likely that you have not provided a unique full text URL for every article. Every article's full text URL MUST be
 unique.</li>
<li>Make sure that the ISSN details in the file you are trying to upload match exactly what we hold for the journal on DOAJ.
Discrepancies may cause the upload to fail.</li>
<li>Make sure your XML file is formatted correctly. There is 
<a href="{{ url_for('doaj.features', _anchor='xml_upload') }}">a sample file here</a>.
You can also check the validity of your file using <a href="http://www.freeformatter.com/xml-validator-xsd.html">an online 
XML validator</a> and the format of your file using <a href="http://www.freeformatter.com/xml-formatter.html">an online 
XML file formatter</a>. Some browsers, such as Internet Explorer 11, have very good built-in XML display plugins that will 
also allow you to make sure that the file is structured properly.</li>
<li>Make sure that you have no HTML codes in your XML. XML files can only contain XML coding.</li>
<li>If you received a message that the file you tried to upload to DOAJ is not valid XML, this maybe because you have
included non-XML codes in the file. If you are using OJS to host your journal and you export the DOAJ XML via the 
plugin, note the details of this particular problem:<br>
There are some fields (e.g. abstract) where it is possible to include HTML code in OJS. OJS uses a third party plugin,
TinyMCE, as an HTML editor for those fields. If you paste text from Microsoft Word into the abstract field, the plugin
also copies HTML and style sheet coding from the Word document into the abstract field. (You can check if this is
happening by opening the field in the HTML view on OJS and you will see the additional code.)<br>
XML can only contain plain text and XML coding. We recommend that when you are creating your articles in OJS, you do NOT copy 
directly from Word. Instead, copy the abstract content into a plain text editor, such as Notepad, WordPad or TextPad, first. You
can also use <a href="http://www.freeformatter.com/xml-formatter.html">an XML formatter</a> to strip out this code before you upload
the XML to DOAJ.</li>
<li>If you get repeated messages that your file has failed, try to upload a handful of articles manually using the manual 
entry method. If this works successfully, then you know for certain that there is something problematic with your file
rather than the upload process itself.</li>
<li>We have created <a href="https://doaj.org/features#xml">a very basic 
template XML file with notes</a> for you. It explains how the file is formatted and 
shows you how each record in the file should be structured. Above the sample is a list telling you whether the field 
is compulsory or not.</li>
</ul>

<br><br>

<!-- SECTION CONTINUATIONS -->

<h3><a id="continuation"></a>12) My journal has changed title and ISSN(s)</h3>
<p>If your journal has a new title then it will also have a new ISSN. This is called a continuation. Continuations occur when
journals change title or merge with another journal(s). We have a special process for continuations that you must follow.</p>
<p>First you must submit a new application for the new version of the journal, with its new title and new ISSN(s). DO NOT ask 
us to update the title and ISSN(s) of the current record in DOAJ. We cannot do this. We must preserve the old version of the 
journal alongside the new version.</p>
<p>Once you have submitted the new application, email us to let us know. Include the title and ISSN(s) of both versions
of the journal in your email so that we can join the two in our system and create a continuation.</p>
<br><br>

<!-- SECTION CORRECTING METADATA -->

<h3><a id="correct"></a>13) How do I correct an error in article metadata?</h3>
<p>If you need to correct an error, you must upload the metadata again. To make sure that your new upload overwrites
the old one, at least one of two specific pieces of metadata in the new file must be the same as in the old file.
The 2 specific pieces of metadata that we look for are, in priority order:</p>
<ol>
<li><b>DOI</b> - if you assign DOIs to your articles then we will match on the DOI.</li>
<li><b>Full Text URL</b> - this is the URL that you give us for the full text of the article.</li>
</ol>
<p>If there is no DOI, the script will look for the Full Text URL.</p>
<p><b>Some examples</b></p>
<p>Use case 1: a publisher wants to correct some article metadata because an author is missing. The publisher must
re-upload the file. The article's DOI in the XML is the same as on the site so the site automatically overwrites the
older version.<br>
Use case 2: a publisher wants to correct the URL for their full text articles because their site has moved.
The publisher does not use DOIs. The publisher must upload a new version. No automatic overwriting
will happen because no matching can occur so the publisher must contact us so we can remove the older version.<br>
Use case 3: one article in an issue contains a spelling mistake in one of the author names. The publisher can correct 
the entry manually, without contacting DOAJ, by logging into their account and clicking on the 'Enter Article Metadata'
tab. Enter the new, correct metadata into the form and submit. Since the URL of the article is not changing, the
correction will overwrite the old version.</p>
<br><br>


<!-- SECTION COMPLAINT -->

<h3><a id="complaint"></a>14) How to make a complaint or appeal</h3>
<p>If you would like to make a complaint, or would like to appeal against the decision to reject your application you
should send an email to the DOAJ Managing Editors, (managing-editors[@]doaj[.]org) that contains the following information:
</p>

<p>
- journal title<br>
- journal ISSN<br>
- reason for complaint or appeal
</p>

<p>For an appeal, you should attach a copy of the original rejection email that you received. Individual cases will 
be discussed every two weeks at a team meeting. After the meeting, and within 
4 weeks of you sending your email, a Managing Editor will email you with the result of your appeal. This will
not be the same Managing Editor who handled your case originally.</p>

<p>For a complaint, your case will be discussed at a meeting between the Editor-in-Chief and the 
Projects and Community Manager. They may consult the Advisory Board. Within 4 weeks of your email to Clara, the Editor-in-Chief
will inform you whether or not your complaint has been upheld.</p>
<br><br>

<!-- SECTION NO SEAL -->

<h3><a id="noseal"></a>15) Does "no Seal" mean we are not indexed in DOAJ?</h3>

<p>No. Being awarded the Seal is completely separate to being accepted into DOAJ. The Seal is an extra mark of approval that 
is awarded to journals in DOAJ. <a href="https://doajournals.wordpress.com/2015/11/03/indexed-in-doaj-versus-the-doaj-seal/">
Read our blog post for further details</a>. Only journals that are indexed in DOAJ can be 
considered for the Seal. </p>

<br><br>

<h3><b><a id="journal"></a>Why can't I find my journal in DOAJ?</b></h3>
<p>It maybe that your journal has not applied to be in the DOAJ, in which case, please 
<a href="{{ url_for('doaj.suggestion') }}">submit an Application</a>. It may be that the journal's application is 
still pending or that the journal has been removed. If you believe that your journal has been wrongly removed then 
please contact us.</p>
<a href="#top">Back to top</a>

<br><br>

<h3><b><a id="solong"></a>Why does DOAJ take so long?</b></h3>
<p>Every application is reviewed manually and by up to 4 people. It takes time to ensure that we do this carefully and
thoroughly. We carry out this process as quickly as possible but also to a very high standard. Currently, due to the number of 
  applications we are receiving every week, it is taking up to 6 months to make a decision on an application or update request. We apologise in advance
  for the extended wait but please be assured that we are working as hard
as we can with the resources that we have. We ask you to refrain for requesting status updates for applications that are under
6 months' old.</p>

<br><br>

<h3><b><a id="uploadmetadata"></a>How do I upload article metadata?</b></h3>
<p>Once a journal has been accepted into DOAJ, article metadata may be uploaded as XML or created manually. If 
the journal belongs to an existing DOAJ account, then you must log in to the existing account and then add metadata 
via the Publisher Area. For more information read <a href="#upload">'Uploading Metadata'</a>.</p>
<a href="#top">Back to top</a>

<br><br>

<h3><b><a id="nometadata"></a>I have uploaded article metadata to DOAJ but it has not appeared on the site. Has 
something gone wrong?</b></h3>
<p>If you did not receive any error messages when you uploaded the metadata then it is likely that everything has 
worked OK. Remember that it may take up to 30 minutes for your articles to appear on the site and up to 12 hours 
for the tables of contents to show your latest uploads. You can check that the articles have uploaded correctly by 
doing a search on the full article title in inverted commas " " or by going to your journal's entry in DOAJ.</p>

<p>If, after 24 hours, you still cannot find your article on the site, please Contact us.</p>

<br><br>

<h3><b><a id="definition"></a>How do we define 'Open Access Journal', 'Quality Control', 'Research Journal' and
'Periodical'?</b></h3>
<p><b>Open Access Journal:</b><br>
We define open access journals as journals that use a funding model that does not charge readers or their institutions
for access. From the BOAI definition<sup>[1]</sup> of open access we take the right of users to <b>'read, 
download, copy, distribute, print, search, or link to the full texts of these articles...or use them for any other 
lawful purpose"</b> as mandatory for a journal to be included in the directory.<br>
[1] <a href="http://www.budapestopenaccessinitiative.org/read">http://www.budapestopenaccessinitiative.org/read</a>
</p>

<p><b>Quality Control:</b><br>
<p>A journal must have an editor and an editorial board. (Only for Arts and Humanities journals will we accept a form of
editorial review using only two editors and no editorial board.)</p>
<p><b>Research Journal:</b><br>
<p>Journals that report primary results of research or overviews of research results to a scholarly community.</p>
<p><b>Periodical:</b><br>
<p>A serial appearing or intended to appear indefinitely at regular intervals, generally more frequently than
annually,
each issue or volume of which is numbered or dated consecutively and normally contains separate articles, stories, or other
writings.</p>

<h3><b><a id="oai"></a>What is Open Archives Initiative, OAI, OAI-PMH?</b></h3>
<p><a href="http://www.openarchives.org/">OAI, Open Archives Initiative</a>, supplies a common framework to web
communities that allows them to gain access to content in a standard manner by means of metadata harvesting.

<h3><b><a id="openurl"></a>What is OpenURL?</b></h3>
<p>OpenURL is a standardized format of Uniform Resource Locator (URL) intended to enable Internet users to more
easily find a copy of a resource that they are allowed to access. It is most heavily used by libraries to help
connect their customers to journal content. DOAJ's OpenURL service is Version 1.0 which is compatible with the
previous 0.1 version as well. Read <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OpenURL">the full Wikipedia entry</a>.</p>

<h3><b><a id="logo"></a>Do you have a logo I can use to show that my journal is indexed in DOAJ?</b></h3>
<p>We have an 'Indexed in DOAJ' logo in .eps and .png formats. Please contact us to
request it and a member of our team will check that your journal qualifies.</p>

<br><br>

<h3><b><a id="seal"></a>What is the DOAJ Seal of Approval for Open Access Journals (the DOAJ Seal)?</b></h3>
<p>The DOAJ Seal is a mark of certification for open access journals, awarded by DOAJ to journals that achieve a
high level of openness, adhere to Best Practice and high publishing standards. To receive the Seal, the journal
must comply with the following 7 conditions:</p>
<ul>
<li>provide permanent identifiers in the papers published;</li>
<li>provides DOAJ with article metadata;</li>
<li>deposits content with a long term digital preservation or archiving program;</li>
<li>embeds machine-readable CC licensing information in articles;</li>
<li>allows generous reuse and mixing of content, in accordance with a CC BY, CC BY-SA or CC BY-NC license;</li>
<li>has a deposit policy registered with a deposit policy registry;</li>
<li>allows the author to hold the copyright without restrictions.</li>
</ul>
<a href="#top">Back to top</a>
<br><br>

<h3><b><a id="sealedJournals"></a>Which journals have the DOAJ Seal?</b></h3>
<p>Here is <a href="http://bit.ly/1JK9YhF">a list of journals that have the Seal</a>.</p>
<a href="#top">Back to top</a>
<br><br>

<h3><b><a id="orange"></a>What does the orange circle symbol next to some journals mean?</b></h3>
<p>These are journals that have been awarded <a href="#seal">the DOAJ Seal</a>.</p>
<a href="#top">Back to top</a>
<br><br>

<h3><b><a id="thetick"></a>What does the green tick symbol next to some journals mean?</b></h3>
<p>The green tick ("The Tick") is displayed against all journals that were accepted into DOAJ after March 2014
when DOAJ launched its new criteria for journals to be accepted into DOAJ. The new criteria require a higher level
of compliance to best practices and publishing standards. Journals that do not have The Tick are in the process of
being reviewed for removal.</p>
<a href="#top">Back to top</a>
<br><br>

<h3><b><a id="api"></a>Does DOAJ have an API?</b></h3>
<p>Yes! We launched a full API suite in 2015. <a href="{{ url_for('api_v2.docs')  }}">Our API is here</a> and you can join the DOAJ API
community by signing up to our Google Groups:</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/doaj-api-announcements">an announcement-only group</a> (e.g. we
release an improved API version or we are retiring a version)</li>
<li><a href="https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/doaj-public-api">a public discussion group</a> for the public api,
so people can benefit from a public archive</li>
<li><a href="https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/doaj-private-api">a private discussion group</a> for the
publishers api, for publishers and others who are authorised to submit applications automatically or modify article
metadata directly</li>

<h3><b><a id="continuation"></a>My journal has changed title and ISSN. What should I do?</b></h3>
<p>When a journal changes title and get a new ISSN, this is called a 'continuation'.</p>
<p>If your journal has changed title then it must have a new ISSN. If you do not have a new ISSN then contact your local ISSN
office. The ISSN must be confirmed and registered at issn.org before you can go further with us.</p>
<p>Once you have the new ISSN then you must submit <a href="/application/new">a new application to us</a> with all of the details
of the new journal, including the new title and new ISSN. After you have submitted the application, send an email to us at
feedback[at]doaj[.]org and let us know that you have just submitted an application for a continuation. Include the OLD ISSN
and title, and the NEW ISSN and title in your email. We will then join the two in the Directory for you.</p>
<a href="#top">Back to top</a>
<br><br>

<h3><b><a id="progress"></a>How do I save my progress when filling out the application form?</b></h3>
<p>It isn't possible to save your Application just yet; it's a feature that we will add in the
future. In the meantime, you could try these two tips to help you keep a record of your application(s):</p>
<ul>
<li>Before you start, print out a version of the form to use as a draft. The form prints best in Google Chrome.</li>
<li>The application form requires a lot of information. Before you start filling it in,
we recommend that you collect up front all the information you will require. We have created
<a href="http://bit.ly/1MLszb4">a
spreadsheet version of the form for you to download and complete offline</a>. For your convenience there are columns
for more than one journal but you MUST complete ONE online application per journal.</li>
<li>If you haven't used the spreadsheet to collect your application's information, you can record your answers by
taking screenshots of the completed form BEFORE you hit the Submit button.</li>
</ul>
<a href="#top">Back to top</a>

<br><br>

<h3><b><a id="casereports"></a>Do case reports count as original articles?</b></h3>
<p>When applying for a journal to be included in DOAJ, you should include case reports in your article count if they
include the retrospective analysis of more than 3 clinical cases. When more than three cases are involved, the
article constitutes "research."</p>
<a href="#top">Back to top</a>

<br><br>

<h3><b><a id="humanities"></a>Do you accept journals that carry out editorial review only (instead of peer review)?</b></h3>
<p>DOAJ recognises that some journals may not publish in a field where peer review is the established form of quality
assurance. Instead a system of editorial review—carried out by the editors or the editors and members of the editorial
board only—is in place. This is particularly relevant to the Arts and Humanities. 'Editorial review' will only be accepted as
an answer to <a href="/application/new#review_process-container">Question 35 of the Application Form</a> if the
journal publishes in some such field. We do not accept journals that only have one editor with no editorial board.</p>
<a href="#top">Back to top</a>

<br><br>

<h3><b><a id="deposit"></a>We have no deposit restrictions on articles published in our journal. Why does the
Application Form ask for information about deposit policies?</b></h3>
<p>Funders, libraries and authors can all access deposit policy directories to get an overview of publishing
channels that are compliant with, for instance, funder policies. This is one of our areas where we are encouraging
Best Practice. A good example of a deposit policy directory is
<a href="http://www.sherpa.ac.uk/romeo/">www.sherpa.ac.uk/romeo/</a>.</p>
<a href="#top">Back to top</a>

<h3><b><a id="getlicense"></a>How do I get a Creative Commons license?</b></h3>
<p>(You may have an equivalent license in your country that is not a CC license. This is perfectly valid for DOAJ.)</p>
<ul>
<li>Choose the most appropriate CC license from the Creative Commons web site—refer to the paragraph below.</li>
<li>We recommend that you apply the CC BY license which is the most user friendly allowing for, among other things,
self-archiving and text- and data-mining.</li>
<li>If you have different licenses for different articles within the same journal, you may only display the most
restrictive alongside your journal in DOAJ.</li>
</ul>
<p>How to choose the CC BY license:</p>
<p>Go to the Creative Commons (CC) web site <a href="https://creativecommons.org/licenses/">
(http://creativecommons.org/licenses/)</a> and copy the CC BY icon - you can also consult this:
<a href="https://wiki.creativecommons.org/Before_Licensing">http://wiki.creativecommons.org/Before_Licensing .</a>
</p>
<p>Put the CC BY icon on the homepage of your journal(s) and on EVERY article.
<a href="https://wiki.creativecommons.org/Marking_your_work_with_a_CC_license">Read how</a>. Best Practice recommends
that the
license metadata is machine readable that is to say: embedded in the HTML, XML or in the PDF metadata.</p>
<a href="#top">Back to top</a>

<br><br>

<h3><b><a id="whichlicense"></a>How do I know which CC license to choose?</b></h3>
<p>You can find information on the different types of licenses at the Creative Commons web site:
<a href="https://creativecommons.org/licenses/">http://creativecommons.org/licenses/</a> and there is even a page
to help you choose the correct license for your content: <a href="https://creativecommons.org/choose/">
http://creativecommons.org/choose/</a>.</p>
<p>Both pages are available in 24 different languages.</p>
<a href="#top">Back to top</a>

<br><br>

<h3><b><a id="embedded"></a>How do I know if my license information is embedded in the metadata?</b></h3>
<p>When applying for a journal to be included in DOAJ, one of the questions asks whether or not you have
machine-readable licensing information embedded in your article metadata. There are
<a href="https://wiki.creativecommons.org/Ccrel">guidelines on the Creative Commons</a> web site that tell you
more about
this. The information must be embedded in the HTML, the XML or the PDFs. Sometimes, it will be embedded in individual
article components too, such as an MP3, an image or a video. The emphasis for DOAJ is not HOW the license is embedded
but that there IS a <b>machine-readable</b> version of it. Here are a couple of examples:
<ol>
<li><a href="http://www.globalhealthaction.net/index.php/gha/article/view/23456">Displayed in the HTML on an article
abstract page</a></li>
<li><a href="http://www.plosone.org/article/info%3Adoi%2F10.1371%2Fjournal.pone.0097648">
Displayed at the bottom of the abstract, as part of the abstract</a></li>

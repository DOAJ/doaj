<h2>Copyright & Licensing help</h2>
<h3>Copyright</h3>
<p><i>Our preference is that the author retains copyright, without restrictions, but DOAJ does also accept journals where copyright is transferred</i></p>
<p>DOAJ recommends that journals allow authors to retain the copyright of their papers, without restrictions. The authors can then grant the publisher non-exclusive publishing rights to publish the articles. The common practice of granting the publisher the right of first publishing is also regarded by DOAJ as a case of unrestricted copyright (because there is no restriction imposed by the publisher on the author's copyright).</p>
 
<p>Sometimes, even though the author retains copyright, restrictions are imposed by the publisher:
  <ul>
    <li>The publisher requires <b>exclusive</b> publishing rights. The author no longer holds the <a href="/application/new#copyright-container">copyright without restrictions</a>.</li>
    <li>The publisher requires <b>a transfer of commercial rights or an exclusive grant of commercial rights</b>. The author no longer retains <b>copyright without restrictions</b>.</li>
</ul>
</p>

<h3>Licensing</h3>
<p><i>Creative Commons licenses ensure that readers know what they can and can’t do with the content.</i></p>
<p>DOAJ recommends using Creative Commons licenses to show readers how the published articles can be used. In some cases, DOAJ will accept a publisher’s own license if it is broadly equivalent to one of the Creative Commons licenses.</p>

<p>The terms of a Creative Commons license may not be added to or changed in any way. For example, a journal cannot write ‘[Other conditions] will apply and prevail over all conflicting provisions of the [open access] license’ model. Creative Commons states clearly that '<a href="https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/legalcode">For the avoidance of doubt, where Exceptions and Limitations apply to Your use, this Public License does not apply'</a></p>

<h3>The difficult bits about licensing and copyright together</h3>
<p>The terms of the user license always apply to readers and not to the copyright holder.
<ol>
  <li>When copyright is retained by the author without restrictions, the license applies to the readers and the publisher.</li>
  <li>When copyright is transferred to the publisher, the license applies to the readers and the author(s).</li>
  <li>When the author retains copyright, but commercial rights are transferred to the publisher, and a non-commercial license is used, the license  applies to the reader and the author.</li>
  <li>When the author retains copyright, but exclusive publishing rights are granted to the publisher, this is equivalent to the transfer of commercial rights to the publisher.</li>
</ol></p>

<h3>Fair use</h3>
<p>An open access journal cannot restrict the rights of the author to fair use only. <b>This is not open access and DOAJ will not accept a journal with these restrictions</b>. A common example of fair use is when a journal allows authors to only retain the rights to:
<ul>
  <li>use the substance of the article in future works, including lectures and books;</li>
  <li>reproduce the article for one’s own purposes, provided that copies are not offered for sale;</li>
  <li>self-archive the article.</li>
</ul>
</p>

 <a name="applyCC"></a><h2>How to apply Creative Commons licenses to your work</h2><br>
 Here are things that you need to consider if you want to start applying Creative Commons (CC) licenses to your journal and articles:
 <ol>
   <li>IMPORTANT Before you start, you must be clear on whether you intend copyright to be retained by the author or whether it must be transferred to the journal. This will determine which license you choose and the wording you must display on each article.</li>
   <li>Decide which license you want to use. Use <a href="https://creativecommons.org/choose/">Creative Common's simple and easy license chooser tool</a>. Be sure to copy the HTML code that it generates. This is important for <a href="https://doaj.org/application/new#license_embedded-container">Question 45 in the DOAJ application form</a>.</li>
   <li>Decide a realistic start date and volume/issue to publish CC licenses on the articles. We recommend that this is at the start of a new volume, or at the beginning of a year but can really be whenever you like. It will depend very much on how easy it is to get the licensing images and text into your articles. (See Steps 4-7 below).</li>
   <li>If you use a manuscript submission system, you may want to configure it so that it adds CC license information to the content automatically.</li>
   <li>Decide on how far back you want to apply the licenses. Will you apply them to older content at all?</li>
   <li>If you publish HTML abstracts, full text HTML or PDFs of your articles, you should display the license in them, using the code from Step 2. (Displaying a logo in the footer of the site is not adequate.) Decide where on the article you want the licensing information to appear. Will it be in a new 'License' section, or as a footnote to the article itself? You may have to talk to the people who host your content as they may have restrictions on where you can display the license. Remember that the license must be displayed on <em>every</em> abstract and full text article and ideally will be embedded in the HTML. For the PDFS, decide where on the PDFs the licensing information will appear. You may have to talk to your production department, Adobe InDesign operator, typesetter, or printer. They will need the correct licensing image from Step 2. If you want to embed the licensing information in the PDF, then they will need the code from Step 2. They should also understand how <a href="https://wiki.creativecommons.org/wiki/XMP">to use XMP to embed the licensing information in your PDFs</a>.</li>
   <li>We recommend that you add licensing information to all versions of your content. However, to answer yes to <a href="/application/new#license_embedded-container">Question 45 in the DOAJ application form</a> you need only do one of these.</li>
   <li>Although the license on every article will link to terms on the Creative Commons site, you will need a page on your journal site that explains both the terms of the license you have chosen <b>and</b> the copyright terms you exert over the content. This page must be clearly written and easy to understand for both authors and regular users. The page must also be easy to find and must be linked to from the journal's home page. If you publish more than one journal it should be linked from every journal homepage.</li>
   <li>Decide what the policy will be for archive material. Will you license all the archive? If so, you may need to contact the authors of the older content.</li>
 </ol>

<p><b>What is the significance of embedding or displaying licensing information in article content?</b></p>
<p><a href="/application/new#license_embedded-container">Question 45 of the DOAJ application form</a> asks:
'Does the journal embed or display licensing information in its articles?' Why do we want to know that and why is it important?</p>
<p>When an open access article is published online, it isn't long before the content shows up in search engines 
like Google. When article metadata is uploaded to DOAJ, third party aggregator services like EBSCO, or library portals at academic 
institutions pick up the metadata for ingestion into their own products. The articles will appear in search results and people who access them
will surf in directly from those results. They may download the PDF, save it and distribute it further without ever having 
visited your home page or Archive page, licensing page or copyright terms. At this point, the article is essentially orphaned from the journal or website where it was originally
published.</p>

<p>The effect that this has is that people read the content in isolation of the terms and conditions applied to the publication of that article. To combat this, article metadata and PDFs should include as much information as possible so that the reader of the article understands: where and when the article was published; what copyright applies to it; what they may do with the content. This last part is essential so that people using, reading, copying or building on the research in the article may do so without breaking the licensing terms. DOAJ recommends that you display licensing information in the HTML view of the article - displaying a licensing logo only in the footer of the site is not adequate - and on the PDF.</p>

<p>Creative Commons actually make a recommendation that licensing information is "embedded" in the HTML and PDF view of an article. If you'd like further guidance on how to do this, use the <a href="https://creativecommons.org/choose/">Creative Commons license chooser</a> which generates the correct code for you. </p>

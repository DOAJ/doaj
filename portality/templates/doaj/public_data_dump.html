    <h1>DOAJ Data Dumps</h1>

    <p>You can access full data-dumps of the entire DOAJ public metadata below.  Data dumps are generated weekly.
        The following files provide you complete sets of articles and journals as JSON, in the form that they would also be
        retrieved via the API.</p>

    <ul>
        {% if show_journal %}
            <li><a href="{{ url_for("doaj.public_data_dump_redirect", record_type="journal") }}">Download all Journals</a>
            {% if journal_size %}
            ({{ journal_size|bytesToFilesize }})
            {% endif %}
            </li>
        {% else %}
            <li>Journal data dump is not currently available; please check back later</li>
        {% endif %}

        {% if show_article %}
            <li><a href="{{ url_for("doaj.public_data_dump_redirect", record_type="article") }}">Download all Articles</a>
            {% if article_size %}
            ({{ article_size|bytesToFilesize }})
            {% endif %}
            </li>
        {% else %}
            <li>Article data dump is not currently available; please check back later</li>
        {% endif %}
    </ul>

    <p>Each file is a <code>tar.gz</code>. The data dumps are structured as follows:</p>

    <p>When you unzip/untar the file, you will have a single directory of the form <code>doaj_[type]_data_[date generated]</code>.</p>

    <p>Inside that directory, you will find a list of files with names of the form <code>[type]_batch_[number].json</code>.  For example
    <code>journal_batch_3.json</code> or <code>article_batch_27.json</code>.</p>

    <p>Each file contains up to {{ config.get("DISCOVERY_RECORDS_PER_FILE") }} records, and is UTF-8 encoded.  All files
        should contain the same number of records, apart from the last one, which may have fewer.</p>

    <p>The structure of each file is as a JSON list:</p>

    <pre>
    [
        { ... first record ... },
        { ... second record ... },
        { ... third record ...},
        ... etc ...
    ]
    </pre>

    <p>Records are not explicitly ordered and the order is not guaranteed to remain consistent across data dumps
    produced on different days.</p>

    <p>The data structures are formatted as per the <a href="{{ url_for("api_v1.docs") }}">API</a>.</p>

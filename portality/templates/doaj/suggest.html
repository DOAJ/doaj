<h1>Apply to be included in the DOAJ</h1>
<h3 class="red">Please note:</h3>

<p>We are currently developing a new application form with much more detailed criteria and so we are unable to 
accept new applications at this time. We will reopen for new applications soon. A preview of the 
<a href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1u0F-fVbEHySkTRXvJLkfd1s_ace9-nTzRYIWdJwSR68/viewform">new application 
form is available.</a> This is not a fully functional form and applications submitted will NOT be processed.</p>

<p>If you would like to receive updates on our progress, please <a href="https://twitter.com/DOAJplus">
follow us on Twitter</a>.</p>

<p>Thank you for your patience.</p>

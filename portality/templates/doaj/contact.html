<p>We welcome feedback, comments and questions from the community about the DOAJ web site and service. If you are sending
feedback about a particular journal, be assured that all communication will be treated as confidential.</p>

<p style="color: red"><b>Before you contact us, read this:</b><br>
<ul>
<li><b>I am a publisher and I need help with uploading or deleting article content, or updating my journal's entry in DOAJ.</b><br>
    <a href="/publisher/">Log into your Publisher Area</a> and click on the Help tab. There you will find tailored help
    adressing these topics specifically.</li><br>
<li><b>I cannot login; I do not have a username and password; I want to register</b><br>
DOAJ is 100% FREE to use. You do not need a username or password to use any of our features. Only publishers of journals indexed in DOAJ
    need a username and password. If you are a publisher and you cannot login, please use our <a href="/account/forgot">
    'Forgotten username/password'</a> service to reset your account.</li><br>
<li><b>I want to publish my article in your journal.</b><br>
DOAJ is not a journal or a publisher. We do not publish content and you cannot submit papers to us. We are an index of open access 
    journals. If you find a journal in DOAJ which you want to submit a paper to, please contact the journal directly.</li><br>
<li><b>I want my journal indexed in DOAJ. What do I do?</b><br>
Have a look at our <a href="{{ url_for('doaj.publishers') }}">Information for Publishers</a> page. If your journal fulfills our
criteria please <a href="{{ url_for('doaj.suggestion') }}">submit an application</a>.</li><br>
<li><b>I have submitted a new application. How long do I have to wait?</b><br>
Due to a large number of applications submitted every week, we have a backlog of applications to process. If you have not received an 
    answer within 6 months, contact us using the form below. Please check your Spam folder first to make sure you have no messages from
    us.</li><br>
<li><b>Please send me articles about subject X.</b><br>
We do not supply that service. <a href="{{ url_for('doaj.subjects') }}">Use our subject browser</a> and then contact 
the relevant journal.</li><br>
<li><b>Please send me a list of journals on subject X.</b><br>
We do not supply that service. You can either <a href="{{ url_for('doaj.subjects') }}">use our subject browser</a>, 
<a href="/faq#metadata">harvest our metadata or download a .csv file</a>.</li>
</ul>

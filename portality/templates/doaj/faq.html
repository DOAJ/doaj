<!-- GENERAL INFORMATION FAQS -->
<h3><b><a name="whatis"></a>What is DOAJ?</b></h3>
<p>The Directory of Open Access Journals is a service that indexes high quality, peer reviewed Open
Access research journals, periodicals and their articles' metadata. The Directory aims to be comprehensive and cover
all open access scientific and scholarly journals that use an appropriate quality control system (see the section below) and is not limited
to particular languages or subject areas. The Directory aims to increase the visibility and ease of use of open access
scientific and scholarly journals—regardless of size and country of origin—thereby promoting their visibility, usage
and impact.</p>
<a href="#top">Back to top</a>
<br><br>
<h3><b><a name="definition"></a>How do we define 'Open Access Journal', 'Quality Control', 'Research Journal' and 'Periodical'?</b></h3>
<p><b>Open Access Journal:</b><br>
We define open access journals as journals that use a funding model that does not charge readers or their institutions for access. From the BOAI definition<sup>[1]</sup> of 'open access' we take the right of users to <b>"read, download, copy, distribute, print, search, or link to the full texts of these articles"</b> as mandatory for a journal to be included in the directory.<br>
[1] <a href="http://www.budapestopenaccessinitiative.org/read">http://www.budapestopenaccessinitiative.org/read</a>
</p>

<p><b>Quality Control:</b><br>
<p>The journal must exercise peer-review or editorial review (particularly in the Humanities), led by an editor, or an editor and an editorial board.</p>
<p><b>Research Journal:</b><br>
<p>Journals that report primary results of research or overviews of research results to a scholarly community.</p>
<p><b>Periodical:</b><br>
<p>A serial appearing or intended to appear indefinitely at regular intervals, generally more frequently than annually,
each issue of which is numbered or dated consecutively and normally contains separate articles, stories, or other
writings.</p>
<a href="#top">Back to top</a>
<p></p>
<br><br>
<h3><b><a name="standards"></a>What are the basic standards that a journal must meet for an application to be considered?</b></h3>
<p><i>DOAJ adheres to <a href="/bestpractice">the Principles of Transparency and Best Practice in Scholarly Publishing</a>, a joint statement published by COPE, DOAJ, OASPA and WAME. We advise that all applicants read through this statement before applying.</i></p>

<p>To facilitate a faster response time, applications are initially triaged to ensure they meet some basic criteria. These are:</p>
<p><b>Coverage:</b><br>
<ul>
<li>Subject: all scientific and scholarly subjects are covered. We use the
<a href="http://www.loc.gov/catdir/cpso/lcco/">Library of Congress Classification Outline</a>.</li>
<li>Types of resource: scientific and scholarly periodicals that publish research or review papers in full text.</li>
<li>Acceptable sources: academic, government, commercial, non-profit and private sources are all acceptable.</li>
<li>Level: the primary target group should be researchers.</li>
<li>Content: a substantive part of the journal should consist of research papers. All content should be available in full text. See our <a href="#casereport">policy for case report journals</a>.</li>
<li>All languages are accepted.</li>
</ul>
<p><b>Access:</b><br>
<ul>
<li>The full text of ALL content must be available for free and be Open Access without delay (i.e. no embargo period).</li>
<li>Registration: User registration online is acceptable on the condition that the journal has a proper Privacy Policy
in place and abides by Data Protection rules. That is to say: user data will never be distributed without the
explicit permission of the user; upon request, a user's email address is removed from mailing lists; all data held about
the user will be made available to the user upon request.</li>
</ul>
<p><b>Quality:</b> The journal must exercise quality control on submitted papers using a peer-review system. The journal—and the
manuscript review process specifically—must have either an editor, or an editor and an editorial board, in place. See our <a href="#humanities">policy for Humanities journals</a>.</p>
<p><b>Periodical:</b> The journal must have at least one ISSN (International Standard Serial Number) registered at
<a href="http://www.issn.org">issn.org</a>. In general, if a journal exists in print and online, then it should have both an
ISSN for the print version and an ISSN for the electronic version.</p>
<a href="#top">Back to top</a>
<p></p>
<br><br>

<h3><b><a name="procedure"></a>What is the procedure for a journal being accepted into DOAJ?</b></h3>
<p><b>Application</b></p>
<p>We must receive an application for every journal wishing to be considered for inclusion. Due to the level of detail required, we recommend that the application is made by the journal's editor or publisher. Once submitted, the application passes through <a href="#standards">a triage process</a> and is assigned to a DOAJ Associate Editor. There are over 40 pieces of
information in every application that we will check and verify. As you complete the application form, remember to ensure that
the journal's web site states clearly and accurately the information DOAJ is asking for in the application form. The things that we will check include but are not limited to:
<ul>
<li>That the journal's ISSN(s) number(s) is registered at issn.org and matches the application;</li>
<li>That the title in the application matches what is registered at issn.org and what is stated on the journal's web site;</li>
<li>That the country of the publisher in the application matches the country registered at issn.org; this may not always be the country to which the journal is registered.</li>
<li>That the journal has an editor or an editor and an editorial board with identifiable members; we will contact you for members' contact details as part of our review process. These will not be made publicly available.</li>
<li>That the full text of articles is free, without embargo, upon publication;</li>
<li>That the journal's Open Access policy is clearly stated <b>on the journal's web site</b> and is easily findable;</li>
<li>That the journal executes some form of editorial review or peer review, that this is clearly stated on the web site and that it matches the answer given in the application form;</li>
<li>That the journal is Open Access according to <a href="http://www.budapestopenaccessinitiative.org/read">the BOAI definition</a>. By this we mean that the journal's articles have
"free availability on the public internet, permitting any users to read, download, copy, distribute, print, search,
or link to the full texts of these articles, crawl them for indexing, pass them as data to software, or use them for
any other lawful purpose, without financial, legal, or technical barriers other than those inseparable from gaining
access to the internet itself."</li>
<li>That any fees for publishing in the journal are clearly displayed in a place that is easy to find;
if there are no charges to authors this should also be highlighted.</li>
<li>That if the journal has any other kind of author charges, they are clearly stated and easily findable on the web
site;</li>
<li>That the language of the full text articles match the language stated in the application.</li>
</ul>
</p>
<p>If the information provided in the
application is unclear or does not match what is on the site, or we think that it is incorrect, the member of our team handling your application will contact you for clarification.</p>
<p><b>Status updates</b><br>
<p>We are unable to provide status updates for any application that is less than THREE months old.</p>
<p><b>Acceptance into DOAJ</b><br>
<p>Upon acceptance into DOAJ, the journal is classified by the DOAJ team according to the Library of Congress
Classification (LCC) system. An automatic confirmation email is sent to the person listed in Question 9; it contains
details on how to log into your Publisher account. You will need these details to upload article metadata. The journal is then visible in DOAJ immediately.</p>
<p><b>Rejection of an Application</b></br>
<p>If your application is rejected, a member of the DOAJ team will let you know, along with the reason for the rejection. A rejected journal may reapply for inclusion once it has demonstrated clearly that it has made the improvements suggested by the DOAJ.</p>
<p><b>Uploading or creating metadata in DOAJ</b><br>
<p>We <b><i>strongly</i></b> recommend that ALL journals provide us with <a href="/publisher/uploadfile">article
metadata in XML format</a> or create the data manually using <a href="/publisher/metadata">our metadata entry form</a>.
A script looking for new articles to publish to the site runs every 30 minutes. DOAJ is <a href="#oai">OAI-PMH</a> compliant and once the article is available in DOAJ it becomes automatically OAI harvestable.</p>

<p></p>
<br><br>
<h3><b><a name="journallicense"></a>How is license information applied and displayed in DOAJ?</b></h3>
<p>The current version of DOAJ allows publishers to supply license information at the JOURNAL level.
Because some journals have different licenses from one article to another, we ask publishers to supply the license
that best fits ALL of the content; this is usually the most restrictive license. We are working to give greater
granularity to license information.</p>

<h3><b><a name="thetick"></a>What does the green tick symbol mean?</b></h3>
<p>In March 2014, DOAJ started to implemented its new criteria for journals being accepted into the directory. All
journals accepted after this date display a green tick symbol:</br>
<img src='/static/doaj/images/tick_short.png' title='Accepted after March 2014'
alt='Tick icon: journal was accepted after March 2014'> appears next to the journal title in search results;</br>
<img src='/static/doaj/images/tick_long.png' title='Accepted after March 2014'
alt='Tick icon: journal was accepted after March 2014'> appears on a journal's Table of Contents page.</p>

<br><br>
<h3><b><a name="java"></a>Can I use DOAJ with Javascript disabled?</b></h3>
<p>If you disable all Javascript, it will not be possible to search the DOAJ. If you can switch off certain components
and allow others, then you can continue to use DOAJ. Search will not work with Javascript switched off completely because
some of the code that is required is served by Google's Javascript library hosting so if disallowed, search will fail.
Other Javascript components are 'Addthis' which is our share feature that allows people to share items from within our
site. Disabling this will simply disable the feature. Another component is Bootstrap (http://getbootstrap.com/) which is the
framework used to build the DOAJ website. This contains some Javascript for some of its features. Bootstrap was
originally created by Twitter and made publicly available. We're not aware of any data collected by Twitter as part of
its integration into the DOAJ site.</p>

<br><br>
<h3><b><a name="browse"></a>What happened to Browse? How can I browse journals by Subject?</b></h3>
<p>The updated Search functionality in DOAJ combines the traditional functions of search and browse into one.
This is an updated way of finding information, in line with the process of filtering and drilling down to the results
that are required.</p>
<p>To browse for journals by subject:<br></p>
<ul>Starting at the <a href="/search">Search page</a>:
<li>Select 'journal' from the 'Journals vs Articles' facet</li>
<li>From under the 'Subject' facet, choose the subject that you wish to browse</li>
<li>To see more Subjects than the 10 listed, change the number at the top of the facet from '10' to the number of
Subjects you would like to see.</li>
</ul>
<p></p>Only journals corresponding to the chosen subject will show. You may make further refinements by selecting other
facets.</p>
<p>We will be adding a Subject browser to the site at some point in the near future.</p>
<a href="#top">Back to top</a>
<p></p>
<br><br>
<h3><b><a name="byCountry"></a>Can I find information about which countries have journals included in DOAJ?</b></h3>
<p>Yes, go to the <a ref="/search">Advanced Search page</a> and select 'journal' from the 'Journals vs. Articles' facet
at the top of the left hand panel. Then expand the 'Country of publisher/publication' facet to show all journals
published by country. By default the list is sorted by country with the most journals, in descending order.To see more
than 10 countries, change the number at the top of the facet from '10' to a greater number.</p>

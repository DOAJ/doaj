<h1 id="explanations">Explanation of XML errors</h1>

<p>The table below explains the different error messages that may appear when uploading article XML. Use the detailed information in the 'Notes' column of your <a href="{{ url_for('publisher.upload_file') }}"><em>History of uploads</em></a> table to correct your XML.</p>

<p>If you cannot get the XML to upload, please refer to our detailed <a href="https://doaj.org/docs/faq/">Metadata Help</a> page, which contains more information, including how to ask for help.</p>

        Check that the file really is valid XML.<br/>
        <br/>
        Sometimes, you may have uploaded/given the wrong file, so double-check that it is correct. For example, you could get this error if you have uploaded a Word document or a PDF by mistake.<br/>
        <br/>
        In other cases, files can look like XML but still be invalid. They should be run through an XML validator to ensure they have the correct structure and that there are no invalid characters.<br/>
        <br/>
        Sometimes, special characters&mdash;especially those in scientific articles&mdash;are submitted in the wrong format. XML does not support many special characters as-is, but those that are supported can be <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_XML_and_HTML_character_entity_references#Predefined_entities_in_XML" target="_blank" rel="noopener">found on Wikipedia</a>.

        <code>Unable to validate document with identified schema</code>
      </th>
      <td>
        No XML schema could be found. The schema, in particular DOAJ’s standard schema, is necessary to read an XML document.
      </td>
      <td>
        Check that the file conforms to the DOAJ schema using a validator.<br/>
        <br/>
        Often, the problem arises because the XML is missing a required tag. The schema validation will fail if you try to upload XML to DOAJ that is missing a specific tag. You can see exactly <a href="{{ url_for('doaj.xml') }}">which tags are required here</a>.<br/>
        <br/>
        If you are trying to upload a file automatically generated by the OJS DOAJ plugin, then you should ask for help in the <a href="https://forum.pkp.sfu.ca/c/questions/5" target="_blank" rel="noopener">PKP OJS Software Support Forum</a>.<br/>
        <br/>
        The DOAJ schema is on our site, here: <a href="http://doaj.org/static/doaj/doajArticles.xsd">http://doaj.org/static/doaj/doajArticles.xsd</a><br/>
        <br/>
        To validate the provided XML against the schema, you can use one of these services:<br/>
        <br/>
        <em><a href="http://www.utilities-online.info/xsdvalidation">W3C Validator</a>
        <br/>
        </em> <a href="https://www.freeformatter.com/xml-validator-xsd.html">freeformatter.com</a>: don’t forget to insert the contents of the schema (XSD) into the bottom box or provide a URL to either of them (you can use the URL <a href="http://doaj.org/static/doaj/doajArticles.xsd">http://doaj.org/static/doaj/doajArticles.xsd</a> for the DOAJ schema).<br/>
        <br/>
        If both of these services determine the provided XML to be schema-valid, please <a href="https://github.com/DOAJ/doaj/issues/new/choose" target="_blank" rel="noopener">submit a bug report</a> or <a href="{{ url_for('doaj.contact') }}">contact us</a> with the relevant details.

        The article belongs to a journal that does not belong to your user account<br/>
        <br/>
        You can only upload XML for the journals that are <strong>in DOAJ</strong> and that appear in the list under <em>Your journals</em> in the publisher area. If you have more than one account and you would like to merge them, please <a href="{{ url_for('doaj.contact') }}">contact us</a>.<br/>
        <br/>
        The ISSNs stated in the article must match a journal owned by the user account from which you are providing the XML file. If the ISSNs do not match any journals or match a journal that is owned by a different account, the import of that article will fail.<br/>
        <br/>
        Note: it is also possible that if an article has more than one ISSN (i.e. an E-ISSN and a P-ISSN), those ISSNs could match more than one Journal (one ISSN matching one journal, the other ISSN matching another). If your account owns both matched journals, this will not stop the article from being imported, but if one of the matched journals is owned by a different account this will cause the import of the article to fail.<br/>
        <br/>
        A journal may have two ISSNs: an ISSN for the print version and an ISSN for the electronic version. Sometimes, the ISSNs of the journal have changed.
        <br/>
        The print and electronic ISSNs you have supplied are identical. If you supply two ISSNs, they must be different: an ISSN for the print version and an ISSN for the electronic version.
        <br/>
        ISSNs provided don't match any journal. We do not have a record of one or both of those ISSNs in DOAJ.<br/>

      </td>
      <td>
        Check that all the Article ISSNs in the file are correct<br/>
        <br/>
        Check that the journal to which you are trying to upload article metadata is indexed in DOAJ.<br/>
        <br/>
        Check that the ISSNs in the metadata are both seen on the DOAJ journal record.<br/>
        <br/>
        If you need to have the ISSNs of your DOAJ record updated, please <a href="{{ url_for('doaj.contact') }}">contact us</a> and we will check that the ISSNs are registered at <a href="https://portal.issn.org/">the ISSN Portal</a> and will then update the record accordingly.<br/>
        <br/>
        If you believe all the ISSNs for the articles are correct, please <a href="{{ url_for('doaj.contact') }}">contact us</a> with the relevant details.

<h1>Help for publishers</h1>

<h2>Uploading metadata/article content</h2>

  <p>There are three ways to upload article metadata to DOAJ:</p>

  <ol>
    <li><a href="{{ url_for('doaj.docs') }}">API</a> (you will need an API key to do this),</li>
    <li><a href="{{ url_for('publisher.upload_file') }}">uploading XML</a>, or</li>
    <li><a href="{{ url_for('publisher.metadata') }}">entering the metadata manually</a>.</li>
  </ol>

  <p>There are instructions and FAQs on how to send JSON using our API on our <a href="{{ url_for('doaj.docs') }}">API documentation page</a>.</p>

  <p>There are instructions on how to prepare and upload your XML file on our <a href="{{ url_for('doaj.xml') }}">XML documentation page</a>.</p>

<p>Are you receiving an error about one of your ISSNs that you haven't seen before? We recently changed the rules for uploading article metadata. We now require that a Print ISSN is in an issn tag and the Online ISSN is in an eissn tag. [See our sample XML file](https://doaj.org/docs/xml/#example-doaj-xml-file) for more information.</p>

<h2 id="explanations">Failed XML uploads explained</h2>

<p>This section explains the error messages that you may see when you upload article XML. Use the message in the 'Notes' column of your <a href="{{ url_for('publisher.upload_file') }}"><em>History of uploads</em></a> table to correct your XML.</p>

<p>If you cannot get the XML to upload, please <a href="https://github.com/DOAJ/doaj/issues/new/choose" target="_blank" rel="noopener">submit a bug report</a> or <a href="{{ url_for('doaj.contact') }}">contact us</a> with the following details:</p>

<ul>
  <li>The time of the file upload</li>
  <li>Whether the error happened once or repeatedly</li>
  <li>Whether you are uploading DOAJ or Crossref XML</li>
  <li>Whether you are uploading a file or uploading from a link</li>
  <li>The exact error message as it appears in the “Notes” column, including the detail under the 'show error details' link</li>
  <li>A screenshot of the error message</li>
  <li>The DOAJ account ID that you are logged in with</li>
  <li>The file(s) you had problems with</li>
</ul>

        Check that the file really is valid XML.<br/>
        <br/>
        In some cases, you may have uploaded/given the wrong file, so double-check that it is the correct one. You could get this error, for example, if you have uploaded a Word document or a PDF by mistake.<br/>
        <br/>
        In other cases, files can look like XML, but still be invalid. They should be run through an XML validator to ensure they have the correct structure and that there are no invalid characters.<br/>
        <br/>
        Sometimes, special characters &ndash; especially those in scientific articles &ndash; are submitted in the wrong format. XML does not support many special characters as-is but those that are can be <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_XML_and_HTML_character_entity_references#Predefined_entities_in_XML" target="_blank" rel="noopener">found on Wikipedia</a>.

        No XML schema could be found. The schema, in particular DOAJ’s standard schema, is necessary to read an XML document.
      </td>
      <td>
        Check that the file conforms to the DOAJ schema, using a validator.<br/>
        <br/>
        Often the problem arises because the XML is missing a required tag. The schema validation will fail if you try to upload XML to DOAJ that is missing a specific tag. You can see exactly <a href="{{ url_for('doaj.xml') }}">which tags are required here</a>.<br/>
        <br/>
        If you are trying to upload a file that was automatically generated by the OJS DOAJ plugin, then you should first contact OJS for help.<br/>
        <br/>
        The DOAJ schema is on our site, here: <a href="http://doaj.org/static/doaj/doajArticles.xsd">http://doaj.org/static/doaj/doajArticles.xsd</a><br/>
        <br/>
        To validate the provided XML against the schema, you can use one of these services:<br/>
        <br/>
        <em><a href="http://www.utilities-online.info/xsdvalidation">W3C Validator</a>
        <br/>
        </em> <a href="https://www.freeformatter.com/xml-validator-xsd.html">freeformatter.com</a>: don’t forget to insert the contents of the schema (XSD) into the bottom box or provide a URL to either of them (you can use the URL <a href="http://doaj.org/static/doaj/doajArticles.xsd">http://doaj.org/static/doaj/doajArticles.xsd</a> for the DOAJ schema).<br/>
        <br/>
        If both of these services determine the provided XML to be schema-valid, please <a href="https://github.com/DOAJ/doaj/issues/new/choose" target="_blank" rel="noopener">submit a bug report</a> or <a href="{{ url_for('doaj.contact') }}">contact us</a> with the relevant details.

        The article belongs to a journal that does not belong to your user account<br/>
        <br/>
        You can only upload XML for the journals that are <strong>in DOAJ</strong> and that appear in the list under <em>Your journals</em> in the publisher area. If you have more than one account and you would like to merge them, please <a href="{{ url_for('doaj.contact') }}">contact us</a>.<br/>
        <br/>
        The article’s stated ISSNs must match to a journal that is owned by the user account from which you are providing the XML file. If the ISSNs do not match any journals or match a journal that is owned by a different account, the import of that article will fail.<br/>
        <br/>
        Note that it is also possible that if an article has more than one ISSN (i.e. an E-ISSN and a P-ISSN), that those ISSNs could match more than one Journal (one ISSN matching one journal, the other ISSN matching another). If both matched journals are owned by your account, this will not stop the article from being imported, but if one of the matched journals is owned by a different account this will cause the import of the article to fail.<br/>
        <br/>
        A journal may have two ISSNs: an ISSN for the print version and an ISSN for the electronic version. Sometimes the ISSNs of the journal have changed.
        <br/>
        The print and online ISSNs you have supplied are identical. If you supply 2 ISSNs they must be different: an ISSN for the print version and an ISSN for the electronic version.
        <br/>
        ISSNs provided don't match any journal. We do not have a record of one or both of those ISSNs in DOAJ.<br/>

        Check that the journal to which you are trying to upload article metadata is indexed in DOAJ.<br/>
        <br/>
        Check that the ISSNs in the metadata are both seen on the DOAJ journal record.<br/>
        <br/>
        If you need to have the ISSNs of your DOAJ record updated, please <a href="{{ url_for('doaj.contact') }}">contact us</a> and we will check that the ISSNs are registered at <a href="https://portal.issn.org/">the ISSN Portal</a> and will then update the record accordingly.<br/>

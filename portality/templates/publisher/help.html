<h2>Help</h2>
<p>Here are some resources to help you with the main Publisher features of DOAJ.</p>

<h3>We have updated our code lists for country, currency and language</h3>
<p>On 3rd February 2020, we updated the code lists that we use for country, currency and language. This means that some codes which were previously recognised will no longer work. These code lists are referenced in our XSD file which all XML uploads are compared against. If your upload contains one of the old codes, the upload will fail. You will see the error <a href="/publishers#Unable%20to%20validate%20document%20with%20identified%20schema">'Unable to validate document with identified schema'</a>. The full details of all the code changes can be found in <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1qpM7E35ctd6wtm-dKAbs3dW359Zo2q3qN3u98-T7P5I/edit?usp=sharing">this list</a>. If your uploads suddenly fail on or after Monday 3rd February then it is worth consulting this list.</a>

<h3>Application Form</h3>
<p>Guides to filling in the <a href="{{ url_for('doaj.public_application') }}">Application Form</a> are available in at least 15 other
languages. <a href="{{ url_for('doaj.translated') }}">Download the language of your choice</a> and refer to it when 
filling in the form.</p>

<h3>The information for my journal is out of date</h3>
<p>If you find that the information which we have for your journal is out of date, please submit an "update request" to us. Do this by clicking on the 'Your Journals' tab and then click the 'Submit an update' link for the journal in question. Before you send the update, double check that the email address and name that we hold in your account is up to date, otherwise we cannot contact you with questions or a progress report. Check these details by clicking on your username in the orange bar.</p>

<h3>The API</h3>
<p>The API is the fastest and most automated way for you to upload content to us. You will need the API key from your account page. If you do not see an API key there, contact us. The API is also the only way for you to update or delete content that is part of your content holding with us. For more information, <a href="https://doaj.org/api/v1/docs">see our API page</a>. We recommend that you sign up to our API groups. <b>Español</b>: La API es la forma más rápida y automatizada de cargar contenido en DOAJ. Necesitará la clave API desde la página de su cuenta. Si no ve una clave API allí, contáctenos. La API también es la mejor forma de actualizar o eliminar contenido que forma parte de su contenido con nosotros. Para obtener más información, <a href="https://doaj.org/api/v1/docs"> vaya a la página sobre la API</a>. Le recomendamos que se registre en nuestros grupos de información dedicados a la API</p>

<h3>Correcting articles on DOAJ</h3>
<p>If you need to correct an article on DOAJ, upload it to us again. Note however that the title and/or DOI of the article must match exactly otherwise overwriting will not occur and you will create a duplicate. Read <a href="{{ url_for('doaj.publishers', _anchor='correct') }}">How do I correct an error in Article Metadata?</a> on our 'For Publishers' page. If you create a duplicate, contact us to delete it.

<h3>Deleting articles from DOAJ</h3>
<p>If an article or a range of articles needs to be deleted, please <a href="{{ url_for('doaj.contact') }}">Contact Us</a>. 
Please email us ALL of the following information:</p>
<ol>
  <li>Name of the journal, as it appears in DOAJ</li>
  <li>The URL of the journal in DOAJ ( which will look something like 
  http://doaj.org/toc/1234-5678 )</li>
  <li>The title of EVERY article to be deleted. If an article appears twice, include details of what is wrong 
  so we know which one to delete.</li>
  <li>If you are asking us to delete a large range of content, there is no need to send the title of every article but 
  you must include the volume and issue range. For example, Volume 1, Issue 1, Jan 2010 to Volume 2, Issue 4, Dec 
  2011.</li>
  <li>Send a screenshot if it will help.</li>
</ol>

<h3>How to report a bug or error to us, or to ask for technical help</h3>
<p>When reporting a suspected bug to us, or another kind of error, or if you need technical help with something, here is the information you need to provide to us. You may not be able to provide the details for all of these but fill in as many as you can. Thanks!</p>
<ul>
    <li>The contact details for the person reporting the bug (or at least a proxy for them, so that we can request more details). That might be you or someone working on your behalf.</li>
<li>The user account you are logged in to when the problem occurred.</li>
<li>At what time the incident occurred. Both date and time ideally. If it happened several times, then all dates/times that were recorded, or a range.</li>
<li>What were you trying to do? As much detail and context as possible. Send a screenshot! An image helps.</li>
<li>What happened, what error message was received? Provide the exact error message, don't paraphrase. A screenshot could be provided here.</li>
<li>Which area of the system did this happen in. Generally, in the UI/API/OAI, and ideally specifically: which URL were you on when it happened, or which URL were you trying to access?</li>
<li>Send copies of any data you sent to the system. For example, article XML files uploaded, or payloads send to the API, if available.
<li>What had you expected to happen?</li>
<li>Was the problem repeatable? Did you try several times with the same result?</li>
<li>What environment are you in? Specifically browser, or if not in the browser then any useful information about your API client such as the user agent.</li>
<li>DO NOT send us your passwords or API keys.</li>
</ul>

<p>Send these details to feedback@doaj.org</p>

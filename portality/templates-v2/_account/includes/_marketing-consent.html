            Your DOAJ account must have an email address in it because we have to contact you with important account and journal information such as security updates; updates to the information we hold about your journal; problems with article metadata, etc. This is part of our responsibility to you to ensure that your journal information is safe and up-to-date.
        </p>
        <p>
            We also send out occasional marketing emails, such as publisher surveys, opinion polls, newsletters and new functionality alerts. For those emails, we need your consent to use your email address. You may come back here and change your response at any time.

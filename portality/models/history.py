        Override usual DomainObject.save method so instead of sending

        directory basis. A new history object should be created every time
        when a new snapshot of an article or journal is needed - i.e.
        they are never changed and re-saved.

        With this implementation if a history object is changed and saved
        a 2nd time (after the initial save to put it on disk):
          - the file will be overwritten (if it saved 2+ times on the same
           day)
          OR
          - a new file will be created in a new directory (if the 2nd+ time

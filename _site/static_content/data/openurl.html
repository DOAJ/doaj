<p><a href="http://alcme.oclc.org/openurl/servlet/OAIHandler?verb=ListSets">OpenURL is for retrieving a resource using a structured URL format.</a></p>

<p>On DOAJ, the parameters included in the request are passed to our search interface, which provides the top result. This means that using OpenURL isn’t guaranteed to find your result 100% of the time, even if it exists.</p>

<p>There are a few things you can try if you keep seeing the <em>Not Found</em> page or getting the wrong result:</p>

<table class="numbered-table numbered-table--labels">
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th> </th>
      <th>Troubleshooting tip</th>
      <th>Details</th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td> </td>
      <td>Use a trustworthy field</td>
      <td>Identifiers like <code class="highlighter-rouge">issn</code> are more reliable than free text like <code class="highlighter-rouge">title</code>.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td> </td>
      <td>Make sure each parameter is correct</td>
      <td>Ensure there are no typos or strange formatting and that the parameter labels are correct.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td> </td>
      <td>Reduce constraints</td>
      <td>Remove some parameters, like specific volume and issue because these may not be present in our index.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td> </td>
      <td>Use OpenURL 1.0</td>
      <td>This will remove the rewriting step from the process (see below).</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

<h2 id="supported-openurl-version">Supported OpenURL version</h2>

<p>DOAJ prefers to receive OpenURL 1.0 requests. However, if the old “0.1” syntax is used, the DOAJ will rewrite it to the new syntax and try again. You will see a redirect to an OpenURL 1.0 URL, then the result.</p>

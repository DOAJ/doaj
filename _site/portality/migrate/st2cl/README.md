This directory contains all the scripts required to migrate from the original SemperTool data dumps to the new DOAJ structure.

All you need to do is run migrate.py with the directory of the XML data as an argument

This has now been run in production, so you shouldn't really ever need it again.

All other files are exploratory/report generating scripts used in the original migration

"""
Mount S3FS-FUSE.

Provides a way to put the various arguments in the app configuration, so they don't have to be passed around the command
line. Should also make it far easier for devs who don't have to remember the s3fs CLI syntax.

Since it uses the app config, it's easiest to have it as a Python rather than a bash script.

## DOAJ Python code style guidelines

### Date formats
Timestamps should use the [ISO 8601](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_8601) standard, e.g. _2017-09-21T13:28:58Z_ - 
note _Z_ for Zulu / Zero, which means UTC. ```dates.now()``` (```portality/lib/dates.py```) provides this.

#### Dates in filenames
Some daily / monthly reports are generated with timestamps in the filename, but these should not contain colons since
this means they can't be opened on some operating systems. We truncate to just the date, rather than the time, for this
use, e.g. _2017-09-21_, generated by ```dates.today()``` in ```portality/lib/dates.py```.

<h3>Become a member</h3> 
<p>
<b>Support DOAJ, make a financial contribution</b>
<br>
DOAJ relies entirely on donations from the community. We urge you to become a <a href="http://doaj.org/doaj?func=loadTemplate&amp;template=publisherpayment&amp;uiLanguage=en">Publisher Member</a>. Members receive a quarterly newsletter and may carry the DOAJ logo on their site.
<br><br>

</p><h3>Guidelines for publishers</h3> 
<p>
<b>One URL for each journal, one PDF for each article</b>
<br>
When a journal gets indexed it will have its own record in the directory.
<br><br>

To make our service comprehensible and user-friendly we find it crucial 
that the link from the directory goes to the URL for the specific 
journal and not to a collection.
<br><br>
Please note that all necessary information (with necessary information 
we are referring to the journal's aims and scope, presentation of the 
editorial board, author guidelines, description of the quality control 
system and information about Open Access) about the specific journal 
should be available on its own URL to make it easier for users to 
interpret the information correctly.
<br><br>
We also strongly recommend you to upload content to your web site 
article by article - not as whole issues. This procedure is also more 
user-friendly since it gives your readers a general view of the content 
and makes it easier for them to find what they are looking for, but also
 to link to specific material.
<br><br><br><br>
<b>Knowledge organization, commercials and ads</b>
<br>
Please pay attention to the fact that having a clear structure when 
organizing your material makes it easier for users to navigate among 
published articles.
<br><br>
Articles should preferably be gathered in volumes marked with the year 
when the articles were published in order to make it easy for scholars 
to cite them (and their readers to find them).
<br><br>
If publishing different types of articles (for example original 
articles, review articles, case studies, essays or book reviews) please 
note that it is advantageous to display articles of the same type 
together in each volume and to mark each article with the specific type.
<br><br>
If you for financial reasons find it necessary to have commercials or 
ads on your journal’s web site make sure that the commercial is not in 
any way offensive or includes information that could decrease the 
credibility of your journal.

<br><br>
Please note that blinking and/or moving objects can distract a reader and make your web site difficult to "read".
<br><br>
Keep in mind that an unclear organization of articles and/or too many 
commercials/ads/blinking or moving objects in the long run can decrease 
the usage of your web site.
<br><br><br><br>
<b>Transparent editorial boards</b>
<br>
We believe that it increases the trustworthiness and credibility of a journal if the reader is able to find/contact him or her.
<br><br>
For this reason we encourage you to be as transparent as possible when 
presenting your editorial board. Information of public interest is:

</p><ul>
  <li>The affiliation of the editorial board members
  </li><li>The contact addresses to the editorial board members
  </li><li>If possible, we recommend you to add a link to the web site 
where the specific editorial board member is presented by his or her 
employing institution.

</li>
</ul>

<br><br>

<b>Quality control and author guidelines</b>
<br><br>
To ensure readers and potential authors that articles go through a 
quality control before publication, we strongly recommend you to 
describe the process on the web site.
<br><br>
Since Open Access is a relatively new way of publishing research papers 
and scholarly materials we believe that it is important showing that 
these journals have the same quality control systems as printed and 
subscription based journals.
<br><br>
Having detailed and comprehensible guidelines for authors is a good way 
of both helping potential contributors and saving your time, since it 
can prevent a lot of unnecessary work.
<br><br>
We recommend all journals to have author guidelines and to include the following in them:

<ul>

  <li>A detailed style guide
  </li><li>Description of the quality control process
  </li><li>If the journal charges any handling fees, publication fees or
 similar from their authors or authors institutions the amount should be
 clearly stated in the author guidelines
  </li><li>Information about copyright (please note the importance of 
informing authors about whether the journal will be the copyright holder
 after publication of an article or if the copyright remains with the 
author(s). This since we strongly believe in the idea that authors 
should be informed about your conditions before submitting their works)
  </li><li>Description of how to submit an article
  </li><li>Contact address
</li>
</ul>
<br><br>
<b>Statement about Open Access and copyright</b>
<br>
Since DOAJ is a collection of Open Access journals we strongly recommend
 you not only to mention, but thoroughly describe the journal’s Open 
Access-policy on the web site.
<br><br>
Clearly stating exactly which rights readers have to use the material is
 a way of showing that you are sharing your published material to 
support a greater global exchange of knowledge. It is also a way of 
protecting your material from illegal use (if you are stating that you 
for example prohibit reproduction or commercial use of your articles, 
misuse could diminish).

<br><br>
Please see a statement about Open Access, fitting our criteria, which could be published on your website:
<br><br>
<cite>This is an open access journal which means that all content is 
freely available without charge to the user or his/her institution.
Users are allowed to read, download, copy, distribute, print, search, or
 link to the full texts of the articles in this journal without asking 
prior permission from the publisher or the author. 
This is in accordance with the BOAI definition of open access.</cite>
<br><br>
Please note any possible contradictions between your Open Access-policy and your copyright.
<br><br>
<b>Licensing your material with a CC-license</b>
<br>
An additional way of showing in which form a journal is Open Access is 
through licensing it with a Creative Commons-license (read more about 
the different forms of licenses <a href="http://creativecommons.org/about/licenses">here</a>).
<br><br>

Such licensing is very beneficial for authors since it for example shows if there are any limits in creating derivative works.
<br><br>
If licensing old material please make sure that you as a journal have 
got the copyright of the published material. If you do not, you have to 
ask the copyright holder for permission before licensing the articles 
(more information can be found at the <a href="http://wiki.creativecommons.org/Before_Licensing">Creative Commons-web site</a>).
<br><br>
<b>Questions</b>
<br>
If having any questions or need advices about how to improve your web 
site and make it fit our selection criteria please do not hesitate to

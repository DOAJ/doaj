<p>The DOAJ Seal is awarded to journals that demonstrate best practice in open access publishing. Around 10% of journals indexed in DOAJ have been awarded the Seal.</p>
<p><strong>Journals do not need to meet the Seal criteria to be accepted into DOAJ.</strong></p>
<p>There are seven criteria which a journal must meet to be eligible for the DOAJ Seal. These relate to best practice in long term preservation, use of persistent identifiers, discoverability, reuse policies and authors' rights.</p>

<h2 id="criteria">Criteria</h2>

<h2 id="further-help-on-copyright-and-licensing">Further help on copyright and licensing</h2>
<h3 id="licensing_1">Licensing</h3>
<p>We recommend that you use Creative Commons licenses to show your readers how the published content can be used. In some cases, we will accept a publisher's own license if it is broadly equivalent to one of the Creative Commons licenses.</p>
<p>You may not add to or adapt the terms of a Creative Commons license. For example, you cannot display on your website: ‘[Other conditions] will apply and prevail over all conflicting provisions of the [open access] license’ model. Creative Commons states clearly that '<a href="https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/legalcode" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">For the avoidance of doubt, where Exceptions and Limitations apply to Your use, this Public License does not apply</a>'.</p>
<h3 id="copyright_1">Copyright</h3>
<p>We recommend that journals allow authors to retain the copyright of their papers without restrictions. Authors may grant the publisher non-exclusive publishing rights to publish the articles. Granting the publisher the right of first publishing also qualifies as unrestricted copyright (because there is no restriction imposed by the publisher on the author's copyright).</p>
<p>Restrictions are sometimes imposed by the publisher even though the author retains copyright:
- The publisher requires exclusive publishing rights. The author no longer holds the copyright without restrictions.
- The publisher requires a transfer of commercial rights or an exclusive grant of commercial rights. The author no longer retains copyright without restrictions.</p>
<h3 id="the-difficult-bits-about-licensing-and-copyright-together">The difficult bits about licensing and copyright together</h3>
<p>The terms of the user license do not apply to the copyright holder. Therefore:
- when copyright is retained by the author without restrictions, the license applies to the readers and the publisher.
- when copyright is transferred to the publisher, the license applies to the readers and the author(s).
- when the author retains copyright but commercial rights are transferred to the publisher and a non-commercial license is used, the license applies to the reader and the author.
- when the author retains copyright but exclusive publishing rights are granted to the publisher, this is equivalent to the transfer of commercial rights to the publisher.</p>
<h3 id="fair-use">Fair use</h3>
<p>An open access journal cannot restrict the rights of the author to fair use only. This is not open access and we will not accept a journal with these restrictions. A common example of fair use is when a journal allows authors to only retain the rights to:
- use the substance of the article in future works, including lectures and books;
- reproduce the article for one's own purposes, provided that copies are not offered for sale;
- self-archive the article.</p>
<h3 id="further-reading">Further reading</h3>

<h2 id="the-application-process">The application process</h2>
<ol>
<li>Your application is successfully submitted when you see a <em>Thank You</em> screen and receive a confirmation email.<ul>
<li>If you do not receive that email, contact us.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Your application will be reviewed by an editor. You may receive an email alerting you when this process has started.</li>
<li>The editor may need to contact you as part of the review process. Please answer any questions they send you. This helps us process your application correctly. Be aware that we will reject an application if, after one month, we haven't received answers to our questions.</li>
<li>The editor reviewing your application may be a volunteer and will not have a doaj.org email address. Check your spam folder frequently just in case the emails have ended up there.</li>
<li>If your application is accepted, you will receive an email to confirm this.</li>
</ol>
<h3 id="time-from-submission-to-decision">Time from submission to decision</h3>
<p>The time from submission to decision varies greatly and is dependent on the responsiveness of the journal contact and/or applicant. Generally a decision is reached within three months.
We cannot provide a status update for applications which are less than three months old.</p>
<hr />
<h2 id="updating-your-journal-record">Updating your journal record</h2>
<p>For journals that have been accepted into DOAJ, it is important that the information we hold about them is up to date. </p>
<p>You can update the journal information by logging into your account and going to your Publisher dashboard. Under 'My journals' is a list of all the journals connected to your account. Use the black 'Update' button, next to each journal record, to submit an update request to us.</p>
<p>A journal update request form will open with the current answers pre-filled. Change any answers that need to be updated. If you haven't updated the journal since before November 2020, when we revised the form, we suggest that you review every answer. Note that some questions may not have an answer, as new questions were added in November 2020.</p>
<p>Once you have amended and reviewed the answers, submit the update request to us.</p>
<p>Update requests are reviewed by the DOAJ editorial team for accuracy and we aim to process them within six weeks of submission.</p>
<hr />
<h2 id="if-your-application-is-rejected">If your application is rejected</h2>
<p>You will receive an email giving the reasons for rejection of the application. Unless otherwise advised by DOAJ staff, you may not submit another application for the same journal until 6 months after the date of the notification of rejection.</p>
<p>You are responsible for providing accurate information when submitting an application. Applications that contain information that is inaccurate or wrong, or that have answers missing, are automatically rejected. 
In cases where journal information is found to be untrue or misleading, DOAJ may decide not to allow further applications from the publisher for a period of up to three years.</p>
<p>DOAJ accepts only journals that follow good publishing practice. If our review finds a publisher is not adhering to best practice, or has questionable publishing practices, DOAJ will not allow further applications from that publisher for a period of up to three years.</p>
<p>Journals already accepted into DOAJ may be removed if they are found to be no longer adhering to DOAJ criteria or publishing best practice.</p>
<p>Please ensure that, if you do apply again after the exclusion period, the journal meets the DOAJ criteria for inclusion and any necessary changes have been made to the journal website or policies.</p>
<hr />
<h2 id="appeals">Appeals</h2>
<p>If you would like to appeal against a decision to reject your application for more than 6 months or remove your journal from DOAJ, send an email to the DOAJ Managing Editors, <a href="mailto:managing-editors@doaj.org">managing-editors@doaj.org</a>.</p>
<p>The appeal should contain the following information:
- Journal title
- Journal ISSN
- Reason for appeal
- Evidence for the DOAJ Appeals Committee to consider
- The original notification of rejection/removal</p>
<p>Appeals are considered by the DOAJ Appeals Committee, consisting of the Editor-in-Chief and members of the editorial team. Committee meetings are held monthly. After your case is discussed a member of the Committee will contact you with the result of your appeal. This will not be the same Managing Editor who handled your case originally.</p>
<p>No further communication will be entered into after the appeal is heard and the Committee has made their decision.</p>
<hr />
<h2 id="zero-tolerance-policy">Zero tolerance policy</h2>
<p>We expect the members of our Team, our volunteers and our Ambassadors to always be treated courteously and with respect for the work they are doing. They should not be subject to abusive behaviour in any form, which includes:

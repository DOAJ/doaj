<p>The DOAJ (Directory of Open Access Journals) was launched in 2003 with 300 open access journals. Today, this <a href="https://blog.doaj.org/2018/11/07/doaj-independence-and-the-importance-of-impartiality/" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">independent</a> database contains over 15 000 peer-reviewed open access journals covering all areas of science, technology, medicine, social sciences, arts and humanities. Open access journals from all countries and in all languages are welcome to apply for inclusion.</p>
<p>DOAJ is financially supported by many libraries, publishers and other like-minded organisations. Supporting DOAJ demonstrates a firm commitment to open access and the infrastructure that supports it.</p>
<p>DOAJ is a co-author to the <a href="/apply/transparency">Principles of Transparency and Best Practice in Scholarly Publishing</a> that provide the basis of the <a href="/apply/guide">DOAJ basic criteria</a> for inclusion.</p>
<h2 id="our-mission">Our mission</h2>
<p>DOAJ's mission is to increase the visibility, accessibility, reputation, usage and impact of quality, peer-reviewed, open access scholarly research journals globally, regardless of discipline, geography or language.

DOAJ is committed to being 100% independent and maintaining its primary services and metadata as free to use or reuse for everyone.</p>

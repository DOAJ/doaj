<h3 id="compliance-status">Compliance status</h3>
<p>This website is partially compliant with the <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG21/" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Web Content Accessibility Guidelines version 2.1 AA standard</a>, due to the non-compliances listed below.</p>
<h2 id="non-accessible-content">Non-accessible content</h2>
<p>The content listed below is non-accessible for the following reasons.</p>
<h3 id="non-compliance-with-the-accessibility-regulations">Non-compliance with the accessibility regulations</h3>
<ul>
<li>Some images may not have a text alternative, so people using a screen reader cannot access the information. This fails WCAG 2.1 Success Criterion 1.1.1 (Non-text content).</li>
<li>Some form fields may be missing a label identifying the purpose of its corresponding field. This fails WCAG Success Criterion 1.3.5 (Identify Input Purpose).</li>
</ul>
<p>We plan to fix these issues to meet accessibility standards by February 2021.</p>
<h3 id="disproportionate-burden">Disproportionate burden</h3>
<ul>
<li>Navigation and accessing information: it’s not always possible to change the device orientation from horizontal to vertical without making it more difficult to view the content. This fails WCAG Success Criterion 1.3.4 (Orientation).</li>
<li>Navigation and accessing information: there’s no way to skip the repeated content in the page header (for example, a ‘skip to main content’ option).</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="content-thats-not-within-the-scope-of-the-accessibility-regulations">Content that’s not within the scope of the accessibility regulations</h3>
<ul>
<li>PDFs and other documents: we have PDFs that were published in older blog posts but are not essential to our services (searching the database and applying to the database). The accessibility regulations <a href="https://www.legislation.gov.uk/uksi/2018/952/regulation/4/made" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">do not require us to fix PDFs or other documents published before 23 September 2018</a> if they’re not essential to providing our services. Any new PDFs or Word documents we publish will meet accessibility standards.</li>

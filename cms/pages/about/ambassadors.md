DOAJ has 13 active Ambassadors, who work with local communities around the world. Ambassadors work within Low- or Middle-Income Countries (LMIC) to raise DOAJ's profile through local outreach and engagment activities. Ambassadors advocate for good practice in open access and publishing, assist with information around applying to DOAJ, and conduct training and events on behalf of DOAJ. 

In 2024, we reveiwed the Ambassador Programme and have implemented a range of changes. In 2025, our Ambassador Programme will have a pilot year where our focus will be on projects led by Ambassadors, supported by DOAJ. If you are interested in becoming an Ambasador, please look out for calls and information that will be published on [our blog](https://blog.doaj.org/).

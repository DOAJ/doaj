DOAJ has 13 active Ambassadors who work with local communities around the world. Ambassadors work within Low- or Middle-Income Countries (LMICs) to raise DOAJ's profile through local outreach and engagement activities. They advocate for good practices in open access and publishing, assist with information about applying to DOAJ, and conduct training and events on behalf of DOAJ. 

In 2024, we reviewed the Ambassador Programme and implemented a range of changes. 2025 will be a pilot year for our Ambassador Programme, focusing on projects led by Ambassadors supported by DOAJ. If you are interested in becoming an Ambassador, please look out for calls and information that will be published on [our blog](https://blog.doaj.org/).

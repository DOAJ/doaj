*All the details about DOAJ's 20th-anniversary celebrations can be accessed from this page, which will be updated throughout the year.*

We are celebrating 20 years of being an important part of open infrastructure with a year-long campaign throughout 2023, and we want to invite you to be a part of our celebrations!

We are holding three events for our community around the themes: 'Open', 'Global', and 'Trusted'. Details about these events and how you can join them will be available on this page. We will also share interviews with key individuals who have shaped DOAJ into what it is today.

Further down the page is a historical timeline to give you a full overview of DOAJ’s important milestones from 2003 to today.

## Timeline 

{.timeline .tabular-list}
- ### 12th May 2003
   - #### DOAJ is born: by the community and for the community
   - The [Budapest Open Access Initiative](https://www.budapestopenaccessinitiative.org/) has been published. At the 2002 [Nordic Conference on Scholarly Communication](https://content.iospress.com/articles/information-services-and-use/isu368), Lund, Sweden, the idea of a directory of pure open access journals is raised. Lars Bjørnshauge, Head Librarian at Lund and future Founder of DOAJ, takes this task on. On 12th May 2003, DOAJ launches with [around 300 titles](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1loav8PNASmpx--eZrUc9IbWr11zOgFOXVZkvGnT4vNg/edit?usp=sharing) from a list generated by [Bo-Christer Björk](https://www.linkedin.com/in/bo-christer-bj%C3%B6rk-20ba4827/).
     - ‘Moreover, some of the projects and the institutional repositories that universities have established have sidestepped the established mechanisms that give order and structure to the published literature. **There is no catalogue of open access journals.** They do not have ISSNs, and are not … indexed in the relevant abstracting and indexing services. They do not use the DOI (Digital Object Identifier) or CrossRef, the system of links from citations to full text. However worthwhile they may be, **if they are not integrated into the existing scholarly literature environment, they will not be found**.’
     - — ‘The First Nordic Conference on Scholarly Communication’. Information Services & Use 1 Jan. 2002 : 191 – 194. [https://doi.org/10.3233/ISU-2002-22407](https://doi.org/10.3233/ISU-2002-22407)
- ### December 2012
   - #### A 10th birthday is coming and DOAJ prepares for another ten years
   - IS4OA, DOAJ’s new parent company [announces a new path of improvement and development](https://is4oa.org/2012/12/18/future-plans-for-the-development-of-the-doaj/) for DOAJ, including plans for extended and more rigorous criteria.
- ### January-May 2014
   - #### New platform and new criteria
   - DOAJ moves to a new technology partner and relaunches with a new website ready for the future! In March, a new extended set of criteria and a new application form are launched, designed to keep questionable publishers and journals out. In May, DOAJ announces that 99.3% of the ~10,000 journals indexed will need to reapply under the new criteria if they wish to remain indexed. At the same time, DOAJ [publishes a list of journals that are added and removed](https://blog.doaj.org/2014/05/22/doaj-publishes-lists-of-journals-removed-and-added/).
- ### July 2014
   - #### Over 6,300 applications
   - In January, DOAJ puts out a call to its communities for help in processing the reapplications. [Crowdsourcing librarian power](https://blog.doaj.org/2014/06/09/crowdsourcing-librarian-power/) is a new approach to help cope with the increasing number of applications being submitted. DOAJ [launches its volunteer network](https://blog.doaj.org/2014/07/01/doaj-editor-and-associate-editor-network-goes-live/) on 1st July with three teams: Chinese, English, and Spanish.
- ### June 2016
   - #### Ambassador program is launched
   - With [a grant from the IDRC](https://blog.doaj.org/2016/03/22/idrc-grant-to-improve-oa-journals-from-the-global-south/), DOAJ launches its Ambassador program and [introduces its new Ambassadors to the world](https://blog.doaj.org/2016/06/20/presenting-the-doaj-ambassadors/). Over time, this proves to be one of DOAJ’s most valuable and successful initiatives and today, it is a model that is copied by many other organisations in the industry.
- ### December 2017
   - #### Reapplication work is complete
   - After three years of hard work, DOAJ [announces that its reapplication project is finally complete](https://blog.doaj.org/2017/12/13/the-reapplications-project-is-officially-complete/) and the last reapplication has been processed. The Editorial Team has rejected reapplications from 2058 journals and then removed a further 2860 journals that never submitted a reapplication. Heavy losses are seen among journals from Japan, Pakistan, Canada, United States and Mexico. 
- ### September 2018
   - #### Plan S includes DOAJ-indexing
   - Plan S [announces its ambitious vision for an OA future](https://blog.doaj.org/2018/09/11/the-10-principles-of-plan-s/), which is closely aligned to DOAJ's work. Plan S has a massive impact on DOAJ, which, over the next four years, will see a surge in applications due to DOAJ-indexing being a vital component of the [Journal Checker Tool](https://blog.doaj.org/2020/07/03/coalition-s-chooses-doajs-technical-partner-cottage-labs-to-deliver-their-journal-checker-tool/).
- ### November 2020
   - #### A new image, a new application form, a new project
   - DOAJ has listened to its publisher community and [makes radical changes](https://blog.doaj.org/2020/11/23/an-update-on-upcoming-features/) to its application form to improve the user experience. Some questions are removed from the form. It is now easier for an application to be submitted, or for a user to save their progress. The DOAJ criteria are rewritten for clarity and [published online](https://doaj.org/apply/guide/) for the first time, in plain English. Usage on mobile devices increases steadily as the site is responsive and more accessible. DOAJ gets a new logo for first time since 2003. At the same time, DOAJ kicks off [Project JASPER](https://blog.doaj.org/2021/11/04/project-jasper-an-update-on-world-digital-preservation-day-2021/), a new iniative to help preserve open access journals.
- ### January 2022
   - #### The next chapter
   - Lars has announced that he is stepping down from DOAJ and a new Managing Director, Joanna Ball, has taken over. A new chapter begins as Joanna [expands the team](https://doaj.org/about/team/) to cover crucial areas of operation. DOAJ [endorses the Action plan](https://blog.doaj.org/2022/03/02/action-plan-for-diamond-access/) for Diamond Open Access, partners with OpenAIRE, and joins two large European projects, [DIAMAS](https://blog.doaj.org/2022/09/20/doaj-joins-diamas-to-support-diamond-open-access-publishing/) and [CRAFT](https://blog.doaj.org/2022/12/20/doaj-joins-new-horizon-europe-project-to-strengthen-technology-for-institutional-publishing/). 
- ### 12th May 2023
   - #### Twenty years old

DOAJ is a unique and extensive index of diverse open access journals from around the world, driven by a growing community. It is committed to ensuring quality content is openly available online for everyone. 

OPEN - DOAJ is a vital part of the global open access infrastructure.

GLOBAL – DOAJ is a global community, with [team members](/about/team/), [ambassadors](/about/ambassadors/) and [volunteers](/about/volunteers/) based in 45 countries around the world, speaking 36 languages.

TRUSTED – Globally, DOAJ's [criteria](/apply/guide/#basic-criteria-for-inclusion) have become a gold standard for open access publishing.

## Our mission

DOAJ's mission is to increase the visibility, accessibility, reputation, usage and impact of quality, peer-reviewed, open access scholarly research journals globally, regardless of discipline, geography or language.

DOAJ is committed to being 100% independent and maintaining all of its primary services and metadata as open to everyone.

## Our vision

DOAJ works to build an equitable and diverse scholarly ecosystem where trusted research can be accessed globally without barriers.

## Our organisation

DOAJ is run and managed by the [DOAJ Foundation](https://datacvr.virk.dk/enhed/virksomhed/45040984), a non-profit community-governed Danish foundation based in Denmark and with its registered office in Roskilde, Denmark. The DOAJ Foundation is governed by its [Articles of Association](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1Z9P7KG0pkOmOsxmTjtU2TRiRZzoKx3QB/view?usp=sharing) and the [Foundation Board](/about/advisory-board-council/), established in September 2024 to support the transition.

Information on IS4OA, the previous managing organisation for DOAJ, can still be found on the [IS4OA website](https://is4oa.org/), and the company will continue to operate until mid-2026 when the transition to the Foundation is complete.

The work done by the [DOAJ Team](/about/team/) is supported by over 100 voluntary editorial staff who help us to review applications. All volunteers are bound by an agreement, and they must declare any conflicts of interest.

DOAJ also has a global network of Ambassadors who promote open access and best practices in their regions. Our Ambassadors are bound by an agreement and must declare all conflicts of interest.

## Partnerships and collaborations

DOAJ partners with many organisations. The nature of the partnerships varies and may include membership, contracts for work, exchanges of information or services, initiative signatories, or access to information resources that assist DOAJ with our application review process.

## Think. Check. Submit.
DOAJ is a proud founder of [Think. Check. Submit.](https://thinkchecksubmit.org/) as well as a contributing organisation and long-standing committee member. DOAJ currently chairs the TCS Committee.

Established in 2015, Think. Check. Submit. was developed with the support of an international coalition of organisations from across scholarly communications in response to discussions about predatory publishing and amid a growing number of new and unfamiliar publishing options available for researchers.

Think. Check. Submit. provides tools and practical resources to educate researchers, promote integrity, and build trust in credible research and publications. Separate checklists for [journals](https://thinkchecksubmit.org/journals/) and [books](https://thinkchecksubmit.org/books-and-chapters/) are available to guide researchers through the key criteria for selecting where to publish their research and are also invaluable to scholarly communications professionals who are advising researchers about these issues. Both checklists are also available in a growing number of languages.

## Diversity

DOAJ believes in the power and value of diversity in scholarly communications. DOAJ is an [adopting organisation](https://c4disc.org/about/adopting-organizations/) of the [C4DISC Joint Statement of Principles](https://c4disc.org/joint-statement-of-principles/). Adopting the Joint Statement of Principles demonstrates our support for improving diversity and inclusion in our industry.

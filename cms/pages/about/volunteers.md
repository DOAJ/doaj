DOAJ volunteers come from various backgrounds all over the world and speak many languages.

Without our volunteers, we wouldn't be able to do as much of our work reviewing applications. In 2023, our volunteers provided 2500 hours of editorial effort and we are so grateful for their help!

As a way of thanking them for their support to us and to the open access community, we have published the names of our volunteers below.

Occasionally, we need more volunteers, especially for help with specific languages. Follow [our blog](https://blog.doaj.org/), our [LinkedIn page](https://www.linkedin.com/company/doaj/) or our [Bluesky account](https://bsky.app/profile/doaj.bsky.social) to be alerted when the next call for volunteers is published.

DOAJ volunteers come from all over the world, from a variety of backgrounds, and speak many languages.

DOAJ would not be able to do the work that we do without our volunteers. In 2021, our volunteers provided 2500 hours of editorial effort! We are grateful for the work they do, helping us review applications.

In recognition of their support for DOAJ and the open access community, we have published the names of our team of volunteers below.

Occasionally, we need more volunteers, often when we need help with specific languages. Follow [our blog](https://blog.doaj.org/) or our [Twitter feed](http://twitter.com/doajplus) to be alerted when the next call for volunteers is published.

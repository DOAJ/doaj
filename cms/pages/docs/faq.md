After your journal is indexed in DOAJ and you start to upload article metadata to us, we generate journal and article metadata. We make these publicly and freely available via different methods:

- Our [Atom feed](https://staticdoaj.cottagelabs.com/feed)
- Our [OAI-PMH service](https://staticdoaj.cottagelabs.com/docs/oai-pmh/)
- [A journal CSV](https://staticdoaj.cottagelabs.com/csv) file (updates every 60 minutes)
- Our [API](https://staticdoaj.cottagelabs.com/docs/api/)
- On our website

Our metadata is collected and incorporated into commercial discovery systems, library discovery portals and search engines around the world. Here are some of them:
- OCLC
- EBSCO products
- Clarivate's Proquest and Ex Libris products
- Clarivate's Web of Science
- SCOPUS
- Google Scholar
- Google
- Dimensions
- CONSER's MARC records

## Uploading article metadata

We are one of the most trusted and reliable providers of metadata about open access journals and articles. When publishers upload their article metadata to us, it increases the visibility of the journal and the articles.

We are committed to providing an open data dump service for the community but in order to ensure that DOAJ's data is used for the benefit of the entire community and under [the terms of the licenses](/terms/) that accompany the data, access to the dumps is granted on a case-by-case basis. If you would like access, please [email the platform manager](mailto:dominic@doaj.org) with the following information:

- your name
- the group, organisation or company you represent or that wants to use the metadata
- the address of that group/organisation/company including country 
- whether you want access to the journal or article metadata, or both
- what you want to use the metadata for (include as much information as possible)

Full data-dumps of the entire journal and article metadata are generated daily for premium metadata service users and monthly for all users.

An [exportable version of the journal metadata](/docs/journal-csv) is also available (CSV format) for immediate download.

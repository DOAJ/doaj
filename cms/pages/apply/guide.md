Before you start the application process, you will be asked to log in or register. The registration process requires an email address. You must use an official email for the journal or an email address that is checked regularly by the journal’s management office.  

Once registered you may begin the application process. You can save your progress and review all your answers before you submit them. To help you, a [PDF list of the questions](/static/doaj/docs/DOAJquestions-for-reference-only.pdf) is available for download.

## Basic criteria for inclusion

### The type of journal that can apply

Open access journals published in any language may apply. Journals should adhere to the [Principles of Transparency and Best Practice in Scholarly Publishing](https://doaj.org/apply/transparency/).

- The journal must be actively publishing scholarly research
  - Any research subject area
  - Publish at least five research articles per year
  - Primary target audience of researchers or practitioners

- Newly launched journals
  - Before applying to DOAJ, a new journal must demonstrate a publishing history of more than one year or have published at least ten open access research articles.

### The type of open access

- DOAJ only accepts open access journals.
- We define these as journals where the copyright holder of a scholarly work grants usage rights to others using an open license (Creative Commons or equivalent). This allows for immediate free access to the work and permits any user to read, download, copy, distribute, print, search, or link to the full texts of articles, crawl them for indexing, pass them as data to software, or use them for any other lawful purpose.
- The journal must display an open access statement indicating that it fulfils the DOAJ definition of open access.
- The full text of all content must be available for free and open access without delay.
  - No embargo period
  - No requirement for users to register to read content
  - A charge for the print version of a journal is permitted

### Journal website

- The journal must have its own dedicated URL and homepage that is accessible from any location
- Each article must be available as an individual, full-text article
  - one unique URL per article
  - HTML or PDF, as a minimum
- Journals that include intrusive advertising will not be accepted. See best practice [recommendations](https://www.doaj.org/apply/transparency) for advertising. 
- As a signatory to the San Francisco Declaration on Research Assessment (DORA), DOAJ does not endorse using Impact Factors or other bibliometrics to assess the quality of journals or researchers. However, journals may display widely adopted metrics, including Clarivate’s (e.g., the Journal Impact Factor), Scopus’ (e.g., CiteScore, SCImagoJR), official national accreditation lists such as Qualis in Brazil or the Norwegian Register, the Eigenfactor, Google Scholar’s h5-index, or article-level metrics including Altmetric and Crossref Event Data.  Journals must not display any reference (images, links, logos) to Impact Factors or ranking metrics from any other service. Journals must avoid being listed in unreliable indexes.
- The website does not need to be in English. If the site is available in multiple languages, the information provided must be the same in all languages.

The following information must be available online and easily accessible from the journal homepage:

- Open access policy
- Aims and scope
- Editorial board (including institutional affiliations of all members)
- Instructions for authors
- Editorial process (peer review)
- Licensing terms
- Copyright terms
- Author charges
  - If a journal doesn’t have any charges, then this must be stated
  - Must include all fees that may be charged to the author, from submission to publication, including:
    - submission fees
    - editorial processing charges
    - article processing charges (APCs)
    - page charges
    - colour charges
  - Any fee waiver must be clearly specified with the conditions of waiver, e.g. amount, time period.
  - If there are charges for withdrawing the article after submission, they cannot exceed the author charges. 
- Publisher information
  - The journal must provide the name and address of the publisher, with a link to the publisher website, if available.  
  - Include the name of a contact person and the journal's dedicated email address.
  - The country given in the application and on the journal website must be where the publisher is registered and carries out its business activities.

### ISSN

- A journal must have at least one ISSN (International Standard Serial Number) that is registered and confirmed at [issn.org](https://portal.issn.org/).
- The ISSN(s) must be displayed on the website.
- The journal's name in the application and on the website must match what is shown at [issn.org](https://portal.issn.org/).
  
### Quality control process

- A journal must have an editor and an editorial board.
  - The editorial board must be listed on the website.
  - The name and affiliation of all editors and board members must be included.
  - Journals that display a list of reviewers must include their names and affiliations.
  - The editorial board for the journal should consist of at least five editors with appropriate qualifications and expertise. It is recommended that board members should not all come from the same institution.
- All articles must pass through a quality control system (peer review) before publication.
  - The type and details of the peer review process must be stated clearly on the website, including the process for special issues, if applicable.
  - At least two independent reviewers should review each article.
- Use of a plagiarism checking service is highly recommended but not required for inclusion in DOAJ.
- Endogeny should be minimised.
  - The proportion of published research papers where at least one of the authors is an editor, editorial board member, or reviewer must not exceed 25% in either of the latest two issues.
  - Where content is not divided into issues, for example in a continuous publication model, endogeny must not exceed 25% in the last calendar year (minimum 5 articles per year).
- It is strongly recommended that articles should display submitted/accepted/published dates.

### Special issues

Journals that publish special issues or other content curated by guest editors must adhere to these additional criteria:

- The Editor-in-Chief must be responsible for the content of the entire journal, including all special issues, which must fall within the scope of the journal
- Special issue articles must have the same editorial oversight as regular papers, including external peer review, and be clearly labelled
- Journals must ensure that guest editors’ credentials are checked and approved
- The Editor-in-Chief or dedicated board members must oversee the guest editors
- Papers submitted to a special issue by the guest editor(s) must be handled under an independent review process and make up no more than 25% of the issue's total

### Licensing

- The licensing terms for use and re-use of the published content must be clearly stated on the website.
- DOAJ recommends using [Creative Commons](https://creativecommons.org/share-your-work/cclicenses/) licenses for this purpose.
- If Creative Commons licensing is not used, similar terms and conditions should be applied.
  - Extra care must be taken to state these terms clearly.
- It is recommended that licensing information is displayed or embedded in full-text articles, but this is not required for inclusion in DOAJ.
- [More about licensing](/apply/copyright-and-licensing/)

### Copyright

- The copyright terms applied to the published content must be clearly stated and separate from those applied to the website.
- Copyright terms must not contradict the licensing terms or the terms of the open access policy.
  - “All rights reserved” is never appropriate for open access content.
- [More about copyright](/apply/copyright-and-licensing/)

### Quality Criteria

When concerns regarding a journal or publisher's quality and publishing practices arise during our regular review process or are flagged by community members, such cases are escalated to the quality team. In addition to the normal application review, this investigation focuses on five key areas mentioned in detail in our [blog](https://blog.doaj.org/2025/01/16/inside-the-quality-team-part-1-how-we-preserve-quality-at-doaj/):
- Presence of clear and reliable key information on the journal's website
- Composition of the journal's editorial board
- Signs of poor peer review processess
- Reputation of the journal, including any association with [paper mills](https://united2act.org/about/), excluded journals or publishers, or other disreputable organisations
- Journal management and operation

We may also refer to the [Prinicples of Transparency and Best Practice in Scholarly Publishing](https://doaj.org/apply/transparency/)

## Additional criteria for some journal types

{:.tabular-list}
- ### Arts and humanities journals
   - For these disciplines ([pages 10-16 only](https://www.uis.unesco.org/sites/default/files/medias/fichiers/2025/04/international-standard-classification-of-education-fields-of-education-and-training-2013-detailed-field-descriptions-2015-en.pdf)), DOAJ can accept journals that undertake editorial review, rather than peer review. Editorial review must be handled with a minimum of two editors.
- ### Clinical Case report journals
   - For DOAJ to include case report journal they must have:
    - A policy on [consent to publication](https://publicationethics.org/guidance/guideline/ensuring-consent-publishing-medical-case-reports) of case details and participant images, and articles must state whether or not this consent was given
    - A policy on potentially identifiable participant information and anonymisation
    - Reviewer guidelines specific for case reports 
   - We recommend that all case reports and case series are identified as such in the title, and that case reports journals encourage or mandate using [CARE](https://www.care-statement.org/) reporting guidelines
- ### Conference proceedings journals
   - For DOAJ to include journals dedicated to publishing conference proceedings, the journal must have an ISSN and a permanent editorial or advisory board providing editorial oversight. Papers from each published conference must be peer-reviewed according to DOAJ criteria. Full text of all conference papers must be available. Individual conference proceedings will not be indexed.
- ### Data journals
   - DOAJ will accept journals publishing research articles about data or datasets, but not journals that simply link to datasets or announce their availability.
- ### Overlay journals
   - DOAJ will accept journals that select and peer-review articles hosted on a preprint server or other site.
- ### Student-run journals
   - If a student body runs a journal, there must be an advisory board for the journal where at least two members have a PhD or equivalent qualification.
- ### Flipped journals
   - Where a journal was previously published as a subscription or hybrid journal and has now flipped to a fully open access model, this information must be clearly displayed:
    - The date of the change to fully open access
    - The availability of the archive material (open access, free, or paywalled)
    - Reuse rights of the archive material (all rights reserved or open license)
   - All content published after the flipped date must be completely open access.
   - DOAJ will consider flipped journals for inclusion if they have a publishing history of more than a year or after they have published at least ten research articles as a fully Open Access journal.
- ### Mirror journals
   - A mirror journal is a fully open access version of an existing subscription journal, with the same aims and scope, peer review processes and policies and an editorial board with at least 50% of the same members. The journal may have a similar name as the subscription title, but it must have a different ISSN. DOAJ will currently accept mirror journals if they meet the usual basic criteria for inclusion.
- ### Subscribe to Open journals (S2O)
   - For journals that have transitioned from closed access to open access under the [S2O model](https://subscribetoopencommunity.org/), all DOAJ basic criteria, including open license and copyright terms must be clearly stated. Before applying to DOAJ, an S2O journal must demonstrate that the current year's S2O target has been met and that it has published a new issue or at least five OA research articles under the S2O model. Additionally the following must be indicated on the journal's website: 
    - The year of transition to open access under the S2O model 
    - A clear indication that all content published during the current S2O year is open access
    - The availability status of previously published content (open access, free to read, or paywalled)
    - The reuse rights for previously published content ( "all rights reserved" or under an open license)
    - The copyright status of the previously published content 
   - When an S2O offer reaches its subscription target, the journal must make all content from that publication year fully open access within the same calendar year. 
- ### Book review journals
   - Journals consisting only of book reviews will not be accepted.

## Best practices

The best practices in this section are about publishing standards based on findability, preserving the content, and ethical publishing practices. We recommend journals to adopt these best practices but they are not mandatory for DOAJ indexing.

### Archiving policy

- The journal content should be continuously deposited in a long-term digital archiving system. Deposits should be into one of these archives:
  - any archiving agency included in Keepers Registry 
  - Internet Archive
  - PubMed Central

### Repository policy

- This is also known as self-archiving. Does the journal have a policy allowing authors to deposit versions of their work in an institutional or other repository of their choice?
- Authors should be permitted to deposit all versions of their paper in an institutional or subject repository:
  - Preprint
  - Author's Accepted Manuscript
  - Published article (Version of Record)
- An embargo should not be applied.

### Persistent article identifiers

- Articles should use persistent article identifiers. DOI, ARK or Handle are the most commonly used.
- All persistent links should resolve correctly.

### Metadata supply to DOAJ	

- Article metadata should be uploaded to DOAJ regularly. [Uploading article metadata](https://doaj.org/docs/faq/#uploading-article-metadata) increases the visibility and impact of published research.

### Artificial Intelligence(AI) and automated tools

Journals should publish a policy on the use of [automated tools](https://bmcresnotes.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s13104-022-06080-6) by authors, peer reviewers and editors. This includes generative artificial intelligence(AI) such as large-language models(LLMs, including many chatbots), which create new content based on training data. At a minimum the policy should include:

-  For authors:  
  - Authors should disclose the use of generatve AI in preparing the article, [beyond straightforward language correction, editing and formatting](https://stm-assoc.org/document/stm-generative-ai-paper-2023/)
  - Authors are responsible for checking the validity of the output of any automated tools used in their research and preparing their manuscript
  - Automated tools cannot be [credited as authors](https://publicationethics.org/guidance/cope-position/authorship-and-ai-tools)
  - Generative AI cannot be cited as a source

-  For journals:
   - Peer reviewers and editors should not use generative AI to create their assessments, [due to risks](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1177/17470161231224552) such as breaches of confidentiality, superficial and non-specific feedback, bias, [hidden prompts](https://asia.nikkei.com/business/technology/artificial-intelligence/positive-review-only-researchers-hide-ai-prompts-in-papers), and false information such as fake references; editing and rewriting may be acceptable if disclosed
   - Any routine use of automated tools by the journal or publisher should be disclosed. The tool should have been appropriately tested
   - Use of automated tools should be overseen by humans (human in the loop). Journals should ensure that an editor or other staff will verify the automated detection of integrity issues such as text similarity, figure manipulation or duplication, or undeclared generative AI use, or automated peer reviewer suggestions

## The application process

1. Your application is successfully submitted when you see a _Thank You_ screen and receive a confirmation email.
  - If you do not receive that email, contact us.
2. An editor will review your application. You may receive an email alerting you when this process has started.
3. The editor may need to contact you during the review process. Please answer any questions they send you. This helps us process your application correctly. Be aware that we will reject an application if, after one month, we haven't received answers to our questions.
4. The editor reviewing your application may be a volunteer and will not have a doaj.org email address. Check your spam folder frequently just in case the emails have ended up there.
5. If your application is accepted, you will receive an email to confirm this.

### Time from submission to decision

The time from submission to decision varies greatly and depends on the responsiveness of the journal contact and/or applicant. Generally, a decision is reached within three months.
We cannot provide a status update for applications which are less than three months old.


---

## If your application is rejected

You will receive an email giving the reasons for rejection of the application. Do not submit another application for the same journal until six months after the notification of rejection.

New applications may only be submitted within six months if these rejection reasons have been resolved:

- Unconfirmed ISSN
- Website unavailable
- Insufficient content published

Where a journal has been rejected for other reasons, a new application may be submitted after six months.

You are responsible for providing accurate information when you submit an application. Applications that contain information that is inaccurate or wrong or that have answers missing are automatically rejected. 

DOAJ only accepts journals that follow good publishing practice. If our review finds a publisher is not adhering to best practice, has provided information that is untrue or misleading, or has questionable publishing practices, DOAJ will not allow further applications from that publisher for a period of up to three years.

Applications will be automatically rejected for:

- Journals or publishers that have had multiple exclusions totalling six years or more.
- Journals or publishers with three or more exclusions, regardless of whether the total duration reaches six years, will not be considered for inclusion in DOAJ if no adequate improvements are demonstrated in the most recent review.

Please ensure that, if you do apply again after the exclusion period, the journal meets the DOAJ criteria for inclusion and that any necessary changes have been made to the journal website or policies.

---

## If your application is accepted

After your journal is accepted, you are responsible for updating the DOAJ record and ensuring the journal continues to comply with DOAJ criteria. See the [Publisher Information Page](/apply/publisher-responsibilities/) for details of how to submit an update request. 

We undertake periodic re-evaluation of journals accepted into DOAJ, particularly when:

- They have not been updated by the publisher for several years 
- Reports are received of website unavailability or questionable practices

Reports of questionable practice will be investigated by the [quality team](https://doaj.org/apply/guide/#quality-criteria). Journals will be removed if they no longer adhere to DOAJ criteria or publishing best practice.

---

## Appeals

Appeals must be submitted within six months from the decision date. Your journal is eligible to submit an appeal if

- It has been removed from DOAJ.
- The application has been rejected, and no new application is allowed for at least one year.

Email the [DOAJ Appeals Committee](mailto:appeals@doaj.org). The appeal should contain the following information:

- Journal title
- Journal ISSN
- Reason for appeal
- Evidence for the DOAJ Appeals Committee to consider
- The original notification of rejection/removal

Appeals related to the outcome of a [quality investigation](https://blog.doaj.org/2025/01/16/inside-the-quality-team-part-1-how-we-preserve-quality-at-doaj/) will be considered by the DOAJ Appeals Committee, consisting of the Head of Editorial and members of the editorial team. Committee meetings are held monthly. After your case is discussed, a member of the Committee will contact you with the result of your appeal. All other appeals will be handled by members of the editorial team.

No further communication will be entered into after the appeal is heard and the Committee has made their decision.

Appeals or complaints that include abuse of DOAJ editors will not be considered. See our [Zero tolerance policy](https://doaj.org/code-of-conduct/). DOAJ reserves the right to impose a penalty on publishers for such behaviour.

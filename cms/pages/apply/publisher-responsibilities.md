- **Confidentiality** - we will only share or discuss details and information collected during the review process with the applicant or an entity authorised to represent the journal.
- **Privacy** - we [will not share your personal data](https://doaj.org/privacy/) with third parties unless you have permitted us to do so. We will always ask you first.

### Your commitment to us

- You will [respond to questions](/apply/guide/#the-application-process) from our editorial team promptly.
- You will [keep your contact details up to date]().
- You will inform us of changes to your journals and [keep your journal records up to date]().

We have [a zero-tolerance policy](/about/#zero-tolerance-policy). We will treat you with respect and courtesy. We expect you to do the same.

### Emails from us

When you register with us, we use your email address to send important information about your applications, updates and journals. To make sure that our emails reach you, consider the following:

- Add helpdesk@doaj.org to your contacts.

**Using an institutional email address**
If you use an institutional email address, your institution may apply extra security measures, such as a firewall. Your IT department administers the firewall.

If they have concerns about doing this, ask them to contact us.

## Applying to DOAJ

### Before you submit an application

1. Read our [Guide to applying](/apply/guide/) (available in [several languages](/apply/guide/#in-other-languages)) and make sure your journal meets all the basic criteria.
2. If you are applying for the first time, [register with us first](/account/register).
3. If you already have a DOAJ account, [sign in](/account/login) to submit a new application.

A [sample of the application form](/static/doaj/docs/2023-07-04-DOAJQuestions.pdf) (Downloads a PDF) is available. Details of the [application process](/apply/guide/#the-application-process) are in the guide.

### Rejected applications

If we reject your application, you will receive an email explaining why and how long you must wait before applying again. [Read the information](/apply/guide/#if-your-application-is-rejected) in the guide.

### Accepted applications

If we accept your application, you will receive an automated email that includes:

If you found your journal in DOAJ but didn’t get an email from us, there are [steps you can take]() to ensure our emails are delivered.

You can [submit an update request](/apply/guide/#updating-your-journal-record) if something about your journal has changed since you applied.

## Your indexed journals

### Displaying the DOAJ logo

To show that your journal is indexed in DOAJ or has the DOAJ Seal:

- You may use the DOAJ or the Seal logo on your journal's website but not on individual articles
- You may only use the DOAJ or Seal logo on a platform or portal website if all of the platform's journals are indexed or have been awarded the Seal
- You can [download the DOAJ logos](https://doaj-kit.netlify.app/building-blocks/logotype/)
- If awarded, you can download the Seal logo from [your publisher dashboard](/publisher/journal)

We have [guidelines](https://doaj-kit.netlify.app/building-blocks/logotype/) about how you can use our logo on your website or in printed material.

### Keeping your journal records up to date
When something changes, you must keep your journal records in DOAJ up to date.

- [Contact our Help Desk](mailto:helpdesk@doaj.org) if you want to change the Title or ISSN of your journal, but [read this section first]().
- [Contact our Help Desk](mailto:helpdesk@doaj.org) if your journal qualifies for the Seal.
- Request a CSV file from us that allows you to update multiple journals and values at the same time and in spreadsheet format.
- For all other changes, log into your DOAJ account to [submit an update request](/publisher/journal). Use the black ‘Update’ button.

### When should I submit an update?

- When the URLs of your journal change
- When you change the fees/APCs
- When journal information or policies change
- When your journal is included in a digital archive, starts using DOIs, or has an entry in Sherpa/RoMEO

If a member of the DOAJ Team has sent you a CSV file, we ask that you complete it as quickly as possible. Full details are available on our [Metadata Help](/docs/faq/) page.

We aim to process update requests within one month.

### Journal title changes, mergers or continuations

- There are [specific rules](https://www.issn.org/understanding-the-issn/assignment-rules/issn-the-major-principles/) about what to do when a journal changes its title.
- You must submit a new application if your journal has a new ISSN.
- We will automatically reject the application if the new ISSN is not confirmed.
- We will review the two records alongside each other to determine if the new title meets our basic criteria. If not, we will reject the application and withdraw the previous title.

### Ceased journals

- If one of your indexed journals will be ceasing publication, let us know as soon as possible by [contacting our Help Desk](mailto:helpdesk@doaj.org). When you contact us, include the ISSN and the title of your journal.
- If another title is continuing the journal, you must [submit a continuation]().

### Journal transfers

If a journal is moving to or from another publisher, let us know as soon as possible by [contacting our Help Desk](mailto:helpdesk@doaj.org). We need the following information from you:

- Journal title
- ISSN
- Transfer date
- Name and email address of the old publisher
- Name and email address of the new publisher

## Journal queries

### Journal is not listed (is withdrawn)

When we withdraw your journal, we will send you an email. Remind yourself of the email address attached to your DOAJ account and check your Spam folder if you haven’t received anything. The email may include information on how long you must wait before you can apply again.

- We have to withdraw your journal from DOAJ if it no longer adheres to our criteria or to publishing best practices.
- We have to withdraw the journal if it is inactive (ceased publishing) or the website is unavailable.

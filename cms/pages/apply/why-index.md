|   | Reputation and prominence | DOAJ is the most important [community-driven, open access service in the world](http://repository.jisc.ac.uk/6269/10/final-KE-Report-V5.1-20JAN2016.pdf) and has a 20+ year reputation for advocating best practices and standards in open access. Indexing your journal in DOAJ will enhance its reputation and prominence. |
|   | Standards and best practice | DOAJ's [basic criteria for inclusion](/apply/guide/) have become the accepted way of measuring an open access journal's adherence to standards in open access publishing. We will help you adopt a range of ethical and quality standards, making your journals more attractive publishing channels. <br>DOAJ is committed to combatting questionable publishers and publishing practices, helping protect researchers from becoming trapped by unethical journals. |
|   | Funding and compliance | Open access publication funds often require authors who want funding to publish in journals included in DOAJ. Indexing in DOAJ makes your journals compliant with many initiatives and programmes worldwide, for example, [Plan S](https://www.coalition-s.org/) in Europe or  [Capes/Qualis](https://sucupira-legado.capes.gov.br/sucupira/public/consultas/coleta/veiculoPublicacaoQualis/listaConsultaGeralPeriodicos.jsf) in Brazil. |
|   | Discoverability and visibility | DOAJ metadata is free for anyone to collect and use, which means it is easily incorporated into search engines and discovery services. It is then propagated across the internet. <br>If you provide us with article metadata for your journal, this will be supplied to all the major aggregators, research organisations, and university library portals that use our widgets, Atom feed, OAI-PMH feed, and API. <br>Indexing your journal in DOAJ will likely increase website traffic and give greater exposure to your published content. Traffic to a journal website typically increases threefold after inclusion in DOAJ. Your journal's visibility in search engines like Google will improve. |
|   | International coverage  | Our database includes [more open access journals from a diverse list of countries than any of the other major indexing services](https://blog.doaj.org/2023/07/06/doaj-is-confirmed-as-a-unique-platform-for-many-open-access-journals-and-a-key-index-for-african-journals/). We have a global editorial team via a network of Managing Editors, Ambassadors and volunteers, so we will do our best to offer local support in your language. We promise you that information about your journal will be seen worldwide. |

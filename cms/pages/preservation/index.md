## Open access journals must be preserved forever

[Esta página está disponible en Español](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1dCxZYO0HDmFWMyazbkayZJtpCYkO9AIf0xqw-z55rU0/edit?usp=sharing).

<img style="float: left; height: 100px; width: auto; margin: .5em 1em .5em 0;" src="/assets/img/jasper/logo.png"> Project JASPER (JournAlS are Preserved forevER) is an initiative to preserve open access journals. It was launched on [World Preservation Day 2020](https://www.dpconline.org/events/world-digital-preservation-day) and is in response to research* that shows that online journals—both open and closed access journals—can just disappear from the internet. This happens because of a lack of awareness amongst smaller publishers around the need for long-term digital preservation and/or the resources to enroll a journal in a long-term digital preservation scheme.

Long-term archiving of research resources is of paramount importance for scholarship. Authors want to ensure their contributions to the scholarly record will be permanent. Scholars must be able to access all of the published research in their fields, both now and long into the future.

As a scholarly community, we are pledged to eliminate the possibility that high-value resources can disappear*. Project JASPER aims to close the gap in preservation coverage that currently exists among open access journals.

## Phase One
Phases One of Project JASPER was a pilot project between CLOCKSS, DOAJ, Internet Archive, Keepers Registry and PKP to scope out a solution that will reduce the number of unarchived open access journals.

## Phase Two
Phase One was considered a success. Phase Two will onboard more journals and the project partners will seek funding for a more sustainable solution, covering a wider journal base.

JASPER's aim is to get more journals archived by establishing a simple process:

- work out which archiving option might be the best fit for the publisher, 
- establish the level where the amount of effort is manageable by the publisher. This is based on the following factors:
  - platform
  - ability to send article metadata to DOAJ
  - ability to export and zip full text, images etc easily
- provide the journal's representatives with the correct information to make archiving happen.

The premise of the JASPER process is that all journals are different, with different needs, different priorities and different resources. The workflow needs to offer viable alternatives to journals so that they engage with one or more archiving services that meet their requirements and capacities. 

### For publishers
We hope that many open access publishers, whose journals are not currently archived, will want to take part. Due to the partners self-funding the project, the criteria for eligibility are several and we are rigorous in applying them. They are:

- Your journal must be indexed in DOAJ
- The abstracts of your articles must be indexed in DOAJ
- Your journal may not charge any fees of any kind, or be subsidised in any way.
- Your journal is not supported by or funded by any organisation that we deem capable of covering the costs of long-term preservation.
- Your journal is not already archived in a preservation service (although it may be archived in PKP PN).
- Your content is licensed with a CC BY licence (although sometimes, we will accept less open licenses).
- The copyright of published content remains with the author.

If you have any questions about these criteria, don't hesitate to [get in touch](mailto:preservation@doaj.org).

#### Archiving options
1. *The OJS route*: OJS journals can use [the PKP PN preservation](https://docs.pkp.sfu.ca/pkp-pn/en/) service which is built on LOCKSS software. You need to enable a plugin in the journal's dashboard and agree to some simple terms. However, your journal must be on the right version of the OJS software to take part. JASPER will make sure that the journals are pointed to the guidance they need to upgrade and become compliant. Journals on OJS may also choose to have their content preserved via the upload route below.

2. *The upload route*: journals indicate to DOAJ that they wish to preserve their content with CLOCKSS. DOAJ matches the full text sent to us with article metadata that we hold. We send everything to a remote folder. From this single location, archiving agencies, such as CLOCKSS and Internet Archive (and, later, other “Keepers”) collect the content.

3. *The web-crawing route*: if you are not able to or do not want to export article metadata and full text, your journal website details will be provided to the Internet Archive for inclusion in a best-effort, automated web harvesting.

#### More copies, better preservation
It is always safer for a journal’s content to be archived in more than one place and, ideally, in at least three. To make this easy for smaller publishers, journals opting for Route 2 will automatically have their content preserved via Route 3. Future phases of the project will add the possibility for Route 1 journals to take part in other routes too.

### For the Keepers
There are often costs associated with adding new journals to a preservation service. JASPER aims to significantly reduce these costs by using DOAJ as a common interface to the thousands of journals indexed in it. By delivering content to an FTP server hosted by Internet Archive, content deliveries are unified into a single format and available from a single location.

Phase One designed, implemented and tested this process, supported by money or services donated by the five project partners. Phase Two will onboard more publishers and seek funding.

### For libraries and universities
Long-term preservation is a profoundly important mission for libraries, universities, and other memory organisations. By supporting DOAJ, the archiving services participating in this project, and in Keepers, you are helping us preserve valuable scholarly content for the long-term and in a very cost-effective way. Thank you for your continuing support!

## About the project partners

### CLOCKSS
[CLOCKSS](https://clockss.org/)  is a not-for-profit collaboration of the world’s leading academic publishers and research libraries. Our mission is to ensure the long-term survival of digital scholarly content and to instill confidence in authors, scholars, policy makers, libraries and publishers around the world that their content will be safely and securely preserved for future generations. We are entrusted with the long-term preservation of more than 51 million journal articles and 400,000 scholarly books. CLOCKSS operates [12 archive nodes](https://clockss.org/archive-nodes/) at leading academic institutions worldwide. This secure, robust, and decentralized infrastructure can withstand threats from technological, economic, environmental, and political failures. A destructive event in one location doesn’t jeopardize the survival of preserved digital content because the 11 other locations serve as mirror sites to backup and repair the disrupted location’s archive. Content is triggered from our dark archive if it disappears from the web, and is made available to everyone under an Open Access license.

### DOAJ
DOAJ is the largest, most diverse, free directory of open access journals in the world. DOAJ's mission is to increase the visibility, accessibility, reputation, usage and impact of quality, peer-reviewed, open access scholarly research journals globally, regardless of discipline, geography or language. By assisting journals to become archived in long-term digital preservation schemes, DOAJ fulfils its mission by ensuring accessibility, visibility and usage of these crucial scholarly records.

### Internet Archive
[Internet Archive](https://archive.org/) is a non-profit digital library with the mission of “Universal Access to All Knowledge.” Since 1996, it has worked with over 1,000 universities, libraries, archives, governments, non-profits, and other memory and social good organizations for preservation and access to the cultural and scholarly record in digital form. It owns and operates its own non-profit data centers, stewards over 50 petabytes of archived data, and provides open-source tools and services for digitization, web archiving, digital preservation, web, and data services, including the [Wayback Machine](https://web.archive.org/) and [IA Scholar](https://scholar.archive.org/).

### Keepers Registry
[Keepers Registry](https://keepers.issn.org) is the global monitor on the archiving arrangements for continuing resources managed by the ISSN International Centre and fuelled by reports from contributing archiving agencies.

### PKP
A research and development initiative within Simon Fraser University’s Core Facilities Program, the [Public Knowledge Project](https://pkp.sfu.ca/) (PKP) develops (free) open-source software. It conducts research to improve the quality and reach of scholarly publishing. As part of its mandate to make knowledge public, PKP understands that preserving and maintaining long-term access to published content is of utmost importance. To support this, PKP has launched a [Preservation Network](https://pkp.sfu.ca/pkp-pn/), a freely available private LOCKSS network that can be used by any OJS journal running an up-to-date version of OJS. PKP welcomes the opportunity to participate in Project JASPER with our colleagues at DOAJ, Keepers Registry, Internet Archive and CLOCKSS.

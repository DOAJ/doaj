Please don't submit articles to us for publication. You should [use our journal search](/search/journals) to find a journal that matches the area of your research and use the contact details on its website.

There are online resources that provide answers to frequently asked questions. The [OA Journals Toolkit](https://www.oajournals-toolkit.org/) and [the PLACE discussion forum](https://theplace.discourse.group/) are two examples and DOAJ plays an active role in both.

Please [contact our Help Desk](mailto:helpdesk@doaj.org) if you want to send us feedback, have questions about our website or services, or have a complaint.

**Potential supporters**

- If you have a question about supporting DOAJ financially, please contact [our Supporters team](mailto:supporters@doaj.org).

**Providing us with information or updates about journals**

- If you want to provide confidential information about a journal we index, [contact our Help Desk](mailto:helpdesk@doaj.org). Please remember to include the journal title and ISSN.
- If you find that the information we display about a journal is out of date, please use the 'Rate this page' button at the side of each journal record.
- If you are the publisher of a journal that needs to be updated, use your DOAJ account to submit an update request from the '[My journals](/publisher/journal)' tab on your Publisher dashboard. 

**Publishers or journal editors**

- If you want us to index your journal, make sure your journal meets all of [our Basic criteria](/apply/guide/#basic-criteria-for-inclusion) and then you can [submit an application](/apply/).
- Publishers with journals in DOAJ will find information about their account and journals on [our Publisher information](/apply/publisher-responsibilities/) page.
- If you need help with journal or article metadata, read [our Metadata help](/docs/faq/) page.

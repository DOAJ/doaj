**Please don't submit articles to us for publication.** Instead, please [use our journal search](/search/journals) to find a journal that matches the area of your research and use the contact details on the journal's own website.

There are online resources that provide answers to frequently asked questions. The [OA Journals Toolkit](https://www.oajournals-toolkit.org/) (DOAJ is a founding partner) and our [metadata help page](/docs/faq/) are two examples.

Please [contact our Help Desk](mailto:helpdesk@doaj.org) if you want to send us feedback, have questions about our website or services, or have a complaint.

If you want to write to us, you can do so at DOAJ, c/o Joanna Ball, BÃ¸gevej 33, DK-4000 Roskilde, DENMARK.

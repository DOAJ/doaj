This accessibility statement applies to [doaj.org](https://doaj.org) exclusively.

Its subdomain [blog.doaj.org](https://blog.doaj.org) and sister site [doajbestpracticeguide.org](https://www.doajbestpracticeguide.org) are WordPress sites and **are not covered by this statement**.

This website is run by DOAJ on behalf of IS4OA. We want as many people as possible to be able to use this website. For example, that means you should be able to:

- Change colours, contrast levels and fonts.
- Zoom in up to 300% without the text spilling off the screen.
- Navigate most of the website using just a keyboard.
- Navigate most of the website using speech recognition software.
- Listen to most of the website using a screen reader (including the most recent versions of JAWS, NVDA and VoiceOver).
- We’ve also made the website text as simple as possible to understand, following guidelines laid out by [PlainLanguage.gov](https://www.plainlanguage.gov) and [PlainEnglish.co.uk](https://www.plainenglish.co.uk).

[AbilityNet](https://abilitynet.org.uk/) has advice on making your device easier to use if you have a disability.

## How accessible is this website?

We know some parts of this website may not be fully accessible:

- The Publisher, Editor, and Admin dashboards (accessible via log-in only) are not responsive and accessible.
- You cannot use the journal or article search function with Javascript disabled.
  - However, if you are using a device that renders JavaScript, the HTML output will be accessible.
- You cannot modify the line height or spacing of the text.

We have recently fixed:

- Made sure all navbars are accessible for keyboard-only users
- Radio buttons in the application form are now focusable
- Search facets are configured for screenreaders to indicate their state
- All pages have a "Skip Links" button so the user can jump to the main content
- In search results, the facets are operable with a keyboard

Fixes that are in progress now after a review of the changes laid out in WCAG 2.2:

- we're changing the ReCAPTCHA method to a honeypot method
- on our forms, start using aria-describedby for hint/help text

We are continuing to update this document as we find accessibility issues or as we fix them.

## Technical information about this website's accessibility

DOAJ is committed to making its website accessible in accordance with the Public Sector Bodies (Websites and Mobile Applications) (No. 2) Accessibility Regulations 2018.

### Compliance status

This website is partially compliant with the [Web Content Accessibility Guidelines version 2.2 AA standard](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG22/) subject to the non-compliances listed below.

## Non-accessible content

The content listed below is non-accessible for the following reasons.

### Non-compliance with the accessibility regulations

- Some images may not have a text alternative, so people using a screen reader cannot access the information. This fails WCAG 2.1 Success Criterion 1.1.1 (Non-text content).
- Some form fields may be missing a label identifying the purpose of its corresponding field. This fails WCAG Success Criterion 1.3.5 (Identify Input Purpose).
- We make users solve, recall, or transcribe something to log in. This fails WCAG Success Criterion Success 3.3.8 (Accessible Authentication)

### Disproportionate burden

- Navigation and accessing information: it's not always possible to change the device orientation from horizontal to vertical without making it more difficult to view the content. This fails WCAG Success Criterion 1.3.4 (Orientation).
- Navigation and accessing information: there's no way to skip the repeated content in the page header (for example, a 'skip to main content' option).

In addition to [institutions & libraries](/support/) and [publishers & aggregators](/support/publisher-supporters/), we also receive financial support from research funders and other organisations. They use our services for research quality assessment and to identify trusted quality journals for assessment, compliance monitoring, and funding allocation. We are grateful for their support.

Our standard annual funder supporter rate, in line with SCOSS suggested rates, is â‚¬8,000.

In addition, we can develop specific service agreements for funders, such as those for developing language-specific resources or participating in projects that benefit national publishing initiatives.

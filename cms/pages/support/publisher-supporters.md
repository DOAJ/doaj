DOAJ relies on the support of publishers and [libraries](/support/) to ensure that its metadata and journal reviewing services remain free for all. The publishers on this page have chosen to show their commitment to quality, peer-reviewed open access by supporting DOAJ. We thank them, as our work would not be possible without them.

## Pricing

We publish our simplified support prices openly in line with [our commitment to the Principles of Open Scholarly Infrastructure](https://blog.doaj.org/2022/10/06/doaj-commits-to-the-principles-of-open-scholarly-infrastructure-posi/).

We only accept support through our publisher supporter model from publishers with journals already indexed in DOAJ. Non-commercial/institutional rates are only available to community-led, smaller publishers with limited funding. [Contact us](/contact/) if you are unsure which category applies or if you want to discuss ways of further contributing to DOAJ's operating costs.

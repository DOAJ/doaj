DOAJ relies on the support of publishers and [libraries](/support/) to ensure that its metadata and services remain free for all. The publishers on this page have chosen to show their commitment to quality, peer-reviewed open access by supporting DOAJ. We thank them as without them, our work would not be possible.

## Pricing

We are introducing a revised and simplified model for publishers to support DOAJ for 2024 and publishing this openly in line with [our commitment to the Principles of Open Scholarly Infrastructure](https://blog.doaj.org/2022/10/06/doaj-commits-to-the-principles-of-open-scholarly-infrastructure-posi/).  We are also relaunching the set of benefits for publishers choosing to support us.

We only accept support through our publisher supporter model from publishers with journals already indexed in DOAJ. Other routes to support DOAJ are as [an institution](/support/) or as [an individual via Paypal](https://www.paypal.com/donate/?campaign_id=4VXR4TJ69MDJJ). Non-commercial/institutional rates are only available to community-led, smaller publishers with limited funding. Please contact [supporters@doaj.org](mailto:supporters@doaj.org) if unsure which category applies.

Please contact [supporters@doaj.org](mailto:supporters@doaj.org) if you want to contribute to DOAJ’s operating costs as a publisher supporter.

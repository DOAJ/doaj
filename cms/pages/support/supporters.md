We are proud that over 80% of our funding comes from academic organisations (libraries, library consortia, universities, research centres). Without this vital support, we couldn't deliver the services the research community expects of us. We are grateful for the trust shown in us by our supporters.

Check [our Institutions and libraries support page](/support/) for pricing and benefits.

      the questions in the form, click this button to show them.</p>
      <p>For now these are quite basic, covering the following fields:</p>
      <ol>
        <li>Print and Online ISSNs: these are checked to see if they are registered and valid in issn.org</li>
        <li>Archiving policy: these are checked to see if the journal is being archived in the selected services, and how current the data is.</li>
      </ol>
      <p>In time, more checks will become available.</p>

    role: publisher
  setup:
    - Have a publisher account which is the owner of 3 journals that are in DOAJ, and which have articles
      uploaded for them
    - Select 1 article from each journal and note its DOI
    - Download the multi_journals.zip test package (see link below in second step)
    - Unzip the multi_journals.zip test package
    - In the identifiers.csv file in the root of the test package, put each of the DOIs from your articles
      next to one of the article directory names listed (removing the existing test DOIs that are present in that
      file already).  For example you will have a line which reads "article1,10.1224/mydoi/3" where the DOI
      is the one from your article.
    - Re-zip the multi_journals.zip package.  This wil be the file you will upload for testing in the below script
  steps:
  - step: Ensure that the archive package has been created with correct structure
  - step: Ensure that the archive package contains more than one article with different journals. 
          A sample zip file is available for testing purpose. If there are no articles with the DOIs specified in the indentifiers.csv
          file in your DSoace instance, 
          the results may not be as expected. In that case unzip the file and update the identifiers.csv file with appropriate identifiers for the articles.

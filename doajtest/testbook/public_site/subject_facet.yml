    results:
    - The subject is selected in the facet
    - The third level of subjects is now visible in the subject facet
    - There is a "selected filter" pill at the top of the search results for the lowest
      level subject you have selected (e.g. Animal Culture), and no other subject
      filters are present
    - The search results reflect your subject selection
    - The number of subjects in the Subject Search box above has increased/decreased
  - step: Select a subject from the third level of subjects (e.g. Cattle)
    results:
    - The subject is selected in the facet
    - If present, a 4th level of subjects are now visible in the subject facet
    - There is a "selected filter" pill at the top of the search results for the lowest
      level subject you have selected (e.g. Cattle), and no other subject filters
      are present

      lowest level subject selected (e.g. Animal Culture)
  - step: Reselect the subject from the third level of subjects (e.g. Cattle)
  - step: Unselect the second level subject, directly above the subject you just selected
      (e.g. Animal Culture)
    results:
    - That subject is no longer selected in the facet, and neither are its children
    - The parent subject (1 layer) is still selected (e.g. Agriculture)
    - There is a "selected filter" pill at the top of the search results for the new
      lowest level subject selected (e.g. Agriculture)
    - The number of subjects in the Subject Search box above has increased/decreased
  - step: Reselect the second and third level subjects (e.g. Animal Culture, Cattle)
  - step: Unselect the top level subject (e.g. Agriculture)
    results:
    - No subjects are selected in the facet

    - There is a "selected filter" pill at the top of the search results for the only
      second level subject (e.g. Forestry)

  - step: Enter another search of 3 or more characters, which will also return the
      values you selected in the previous step (e.g. "Bio")

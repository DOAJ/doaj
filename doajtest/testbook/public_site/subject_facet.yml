  steps:
  - step: Go to the DOAJ journal search page at /search/journals
  - step: Select a subject from the subject facet (e.g. Agriculture)
    results:
    - The subject is selected in the facet
    - The subject's children are now visible in the subject facet
    - All other top level subjects are still visible in the subject facet
    - There is a "selected filter" pill at the top of the search results for the subject
      you selected
    - The search results reflect your subject selection
    - The number of subjects changes in the Subject Search box above.
  - step: Select a subject from the second level of subjects (e.g. Animal Culture)
    results:
    - The subject is selected in the facet
    - The third level of subjects is now visible in the subject facet
    - There is a "selected filter" pill at the top of the search results for the lowest
      level subject you have selected (e.g. Animal Culture), and no other subject
      filters are present
    - The search results reflect your subject selection
    - The number of subjects in the Subject Search box above has increased/decreased
  - step: Select a subject from the third level of subjects (e.g. Cattle)
    results:
    - The subject is selected in the facet
    - If present, a 4th level of subjects are now visible in the subject facet
    - There is a "selected filter" pill at the top of the search results for the lowest
      level subject you have selected (e.g. Cattle), and no other subject filters
      are present
    - The search results reflect your subject selection
    - The number of subjects in the Subject Search box above has increased/decreased
  - step: Unselect the subject you selected from the third level (e.g. Cattle)
    results:
    - The subject is no longer selected in the facet
    - Its parent subjects (2 layers) are still selected
    - There is a "selected filter" pill at the top of the search results for the new
      lowest level subject selected (e.g. Animal Culture)
  - step: Reselect the subject from the third level of subjects (e.g. Cattle)
  - step: Unselect the second level subject, directly above the subject you just selected
      (e.g. Animal Culture)
    results:
    - That subject is no longer selected in the facet, and neither are its children
    - The parent subject (1 layer) is still selected (e.g. Agriculture)
    - There is a "selected filter" pill at the top of the search results for the new
      lowest level subject selected (e.g. Agriculture)
    - The number of subjects in the Subject Search box above has increased/decreased
  - step: Reselect the second and third level subjects (e.g. Animal Culture, Cattle)
  - step: Unselect the top level subject (e.g. Agriculture)
    results:
    - No subjects are selected in the facet
    - There is no "selected filter" on the search
- title: Multiple Subject Selection
  context:
    role: anonymous
  steps:
  - step: Go to the DOAJ journal search page at /search/journals
  - step: Select a subject from the subject facet (e.g. Agriculture)
  - step: Select two of the children from the second level (e.g. Forestry and Animal
      Culture)
    results:
    - Both subjects (and their parent) are selected in the facet
    - There is a "selected filter" pill at the top of the search results for both
      second level subjects you selected
  - step: Uselect one of the second level subjects (e.g. Animal Culture)
    results:
    - The other selected subject is still selected (along with its parent)
    - There is a "selected filter" pill at the top of the search results for the only
      second level subject (e.g. Forestry)
  - step: Reselect one of the second level subjects (e.g. Animal Culture)
  - step: Unselect the top level subject (e.g. Agriculture)
    results:
    - No subjects are selected in the facet
    - There is no "selected filter" on the search
- title: Search for an entry
  context:
    role: anonymous
  steps:
  - step: Go to the DOAJ journal search page at /search/journals
  - step: Place your cursor in the Subject search box
  - step: Type a single character (e.g. "F")
    results:
    - A hint to type 3 characters or more to search is displayed
  - step: Enter 3 characters (e.g. "Fin")
    results:
    - A list of subjects are displayed.  The full tree is shown (with all children
      expanded), where there is a match somewhere in each branch
    - Your search string is highlighted in bold on each term where it appears
  - step: Delete the last character of your search (so you now have, for example,
      "Fi")
    results:
    - A hint to type 3 characters or more to search is displayed
  - step: Delete the remaining 2 characters of your search, so there is nothing in
      the search box
    results:
    - The original subject facet content is shown, with a single level of subjects
  - step: Enter 3 characters (e.g. "Fin")
  - step: Select a subject (try one that is several levels deep, e.g. Technology >
      Chemical Technology)
    results:
    - The subject and any parents are selected in the facet
    - The facet status hasn't changed - the search query is still visible in the search box and the tree is filtered
  - step: Enter another search of 3 or more characters, which will also return the
      values you selected in the previous step (e.g. "Bio")
    results:
    - A list of subjects are displayed.  The full tree is shown (with all children
      expanded), where there is a match somewhere in each branch
    - Your search string is highlighted in bold on each term where it appears
    - Your previously selected values are displayed as selected within the tree
  - step: Select another subject from another part of the tree (e.g. Medicine)
    results:
    - All your subjects and any parents are selected in the facet
    - The facet status hasn't changed - the last search query is displayed in the input field and the tree is filtered
  - step: Enter your second search again (e.g. "Bio")
  - step: Unselect one of the subjects you had previously selected (e.g. Chemical
      Technology)
    results:
    - Your second subject is still present (e.g. Medicine) and any parents of the
      subject you unselected are still present (e.g. Technology)
    - The facet status hasn't changed - the last search query is displayed in the input field and the tree is filtered
  - step: Enter a long random string into the search box
    results:
    - A message is displayed "No subjects match your search"
  - step: Remove a string from the search box
    results:
    - The facet shows all subjects with all levels folded
